Getting smallpox has a direct effect on black hair. Vaccination reaction has a direct effect on black hair. For unvaccinated individuals, the probability of black hair is 27%. For vaccinated individuals, the probability of black hair is 37%. Will vaccination decrease the chance of black hair?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
