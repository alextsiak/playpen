Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For people who do not listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 61%. For people who listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 79%. For people who listen to jazz, would it be less likely to see lung cancer if the person did not listen to jazz?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
