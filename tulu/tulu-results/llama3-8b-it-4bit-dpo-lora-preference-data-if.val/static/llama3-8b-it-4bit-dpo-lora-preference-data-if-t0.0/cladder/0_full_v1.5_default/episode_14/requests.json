Smoking has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. Gender is unobserved. The overall probability of smoking is 12%. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 58%. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 61%. Is lung cancer more likely than absence of lung cancer overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of smoking on lung cancer implies that smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer. The given probabilities are: the overall probability of smoking is 12",
