The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: The man in the room has a direct effect on room. The candle has a direct effect on room. Method 1: We look directly at how the man in the room correlates with room in general. Method 2: We look at this correlation case by case according to the candle. To understand how the man in the room affects room, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In Method 2, we are conditioning on the presence of the candle, which itself has a direct effect on the room. This means that the correlation between the man in",
