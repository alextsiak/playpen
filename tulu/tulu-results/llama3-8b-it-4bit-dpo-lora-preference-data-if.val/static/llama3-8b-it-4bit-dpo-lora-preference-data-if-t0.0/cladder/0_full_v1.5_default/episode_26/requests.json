Residency status has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. Residency status is unobserved. The overall probability of male gender is 13%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 61%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 65%.

The direct effect of gender on admission status is that males have a higher probability of admission acceptance (65%) compared to females (61%). However, the direct effect",
