The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Wibl has a direct effect on zuph and uvzi. Zuph has a direct effect on uvzi. Method 1: We look at how zuph correlates with uvzi case by case according to wibl. Method 2: We look directly at how zuph correlates with uvzi in general. To understand how zuph affects uvzi, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In this hypothetical world, Wibl has a direct effect on both zuph and uvzi. This means that Wibl is a confounding variable, which",
