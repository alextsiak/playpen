The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Poverty has a direct effect on liking spicy food and cholera. Water company has a direct effect on liking spicy food. Liking spicy food has a direct effect on cholera. Poverty is unobserved. The overall probability of liking spicy food is 41%. For people who do not like spicy food, the probability of cholera contraction is 59%. For people who like spicy food, the probability of cholera contraction is 33%. Is cholera contraction more likely than cholera prevention overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
