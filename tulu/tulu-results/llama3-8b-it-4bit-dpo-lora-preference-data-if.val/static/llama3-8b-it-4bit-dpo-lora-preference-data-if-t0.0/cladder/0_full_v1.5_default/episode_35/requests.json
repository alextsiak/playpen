The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and having visited England. Having visited England has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For CEOs who fire employees and have not visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 21%. For CEOs who fire employees and have visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 51%. For CEOs who fire employees and have not visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 35%. For CEOs who fire employees and have visited England, the probability of employee being fired is 66%. The overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 28%. Will having visited England increase the chance of employee being fired?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The key to this problem lies in understanding the conditional probabilities and the effect of visiting England on the employee being fired, given the CEO's decision to fire.\n\n",
