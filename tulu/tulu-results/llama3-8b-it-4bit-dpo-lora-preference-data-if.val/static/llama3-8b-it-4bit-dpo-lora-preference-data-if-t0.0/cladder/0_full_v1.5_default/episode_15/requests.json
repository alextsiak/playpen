Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 78%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 32%. For husbands that set the alarm, would it be less likely to see ringing alarm if the husband had not set the alarm?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The given conditions state that the husband has a direct effect on the wife and alarm clock, and the wife has a direct effect on the alarm clock. However,",
