The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Hwax has a direct effect on kraz and pexu. Pexu has a direct effect on rukz. Kraz has a direct effect on rukz. The overall probability of pexu is 41%. For those who are not pexu, the probability of rukz is 66%. For those who are pexu, the probability of rukz is 22%. Is rukz more likely than not rukz overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
