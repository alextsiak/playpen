The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Yupt has a direct effect on zupj and muvq. Zupj has a direct effect on muvq. The overall probability of yupt is 1%. For those who are not yupt, the probability of muvq is 33%. For those who are yupt, the probability of muvq is 59%. Is muvq more likely than not muvq overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
