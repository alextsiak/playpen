The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on foot size. Going to the beach has a direct effect on foot size. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 10%. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of large feet is 13%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of large feet is 70%. Is large feet more likely than small feet overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
