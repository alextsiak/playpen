The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. Method 1: We look at how manager correlates with employee case by case according to director. Method 2: We look directly at how manager correlates with employee in general. To understand how manager affects employee, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In Method 1, the correlation between manager and employee is examined case by case according to the director. This introduces a confounding variable, the director, which affects both",
