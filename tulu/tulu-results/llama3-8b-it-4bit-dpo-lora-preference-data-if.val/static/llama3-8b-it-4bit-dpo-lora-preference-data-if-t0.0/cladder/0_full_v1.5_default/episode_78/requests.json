The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Wibl has a direct effect on vubr and zuph. Zuph has a direct effect on uvzi. Vubr has a direct effect on uvzi. For those who are not wibl and are not zuph, the probability of uvzi is 77%. For those who are not wibl and are zuph, the probability of uvzi is 63%. For those who are wibl and are not zuph, the probability of uvzi is 54%. For those who are wibl and are zuph, the probability of uvzi is 76%. The overall probability of wibl is 23%. Will zuph increase the chance of uvzi?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The key insight here is to recognize that the effect of zuph on uvzi is not a direct effect,",
