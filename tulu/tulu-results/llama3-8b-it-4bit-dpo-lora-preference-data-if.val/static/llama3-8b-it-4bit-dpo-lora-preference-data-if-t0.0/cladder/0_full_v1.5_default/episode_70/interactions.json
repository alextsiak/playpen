Tijv has a direct effect on gyzp. Tijw has a direct effect on gyzp. The overall probability of xevo is 48%. For those who are not xevo, the probability of gyzp is 39%. For those who are xevo, the probability of gyzp is 78%. Is gyzp more likely than not gyzp overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
