Gwet has a direct effect on xevu. For those who are not yomx, the probability of xevu is 68%. For those who are yomx, the probability of xevu is 40%. For those who are yomx, would it be less likely to see xevu if the individual was not yomx?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",
