	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. The overall probability of male gender is 54%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 49%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 24%. Is admission acceptance less likely than admission rejection overall?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	  \tt {\tiny [A$\rangle$GM]}  
	 Yes\\ \tt \\ \tt To answer this question, we need to consider the given probabilities and the causal relationships between the variables. The direct effect of gender on department competitiveness and admission status implies that the effect of gender on admission status is not mediated by department competitiveness.
