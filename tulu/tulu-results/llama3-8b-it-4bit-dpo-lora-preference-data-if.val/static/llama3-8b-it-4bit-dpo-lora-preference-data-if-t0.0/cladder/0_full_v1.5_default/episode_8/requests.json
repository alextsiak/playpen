The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gender has a direct effect on department competitiveness and admission status. Department competitiveness has a direct effect on admission status. The overall probability of male gender is 54%. For individuals who are not male, the probability of admission acceptance is 49%. For individuals who are male, the probability of admission acceptance is 24%. Is admission acceptance less likely than admission rejection overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The direct effect of gender on department competitiveness and admission status implies that the effect of gender on admission status is not mediated by department competitiveness. \n\n",
