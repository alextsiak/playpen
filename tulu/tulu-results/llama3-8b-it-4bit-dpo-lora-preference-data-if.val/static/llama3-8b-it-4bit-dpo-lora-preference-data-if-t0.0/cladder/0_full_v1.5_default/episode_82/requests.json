The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Kwox has a direct effect on kwoz. Swoq has a direct effect on kwoz. The overall probability of kwox is 1%. For those who are not kwox, the probability of kwoz is 47%. For those who are kwox, the probability of kwoz is 92%. Is kwoz less likely than not kwoz overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

We can do this by considering two groups: those who are kwox and those who are not kwox.\n\nThe probability of kwoz for",
