Here are a few options to consider:\n\n1. **Positive Reinforcement Training**: This method focuses on rewarding good behavior with treats, praise, and affection. It's a gentle and effective approach that helps build trust between you and your puppy.\n2. **Clicker Training**: This technique uses a small device that makes a \"click\" sound to mark good behavior, followed by a reward. It's a fun and engaging way to teach your puppy new tricks.\n3. **Operant Conditioning**: This method uses consequences, such as treats or time-outs, to teach your puppy what is and isn't acceptable behavior. It's a more structured approach that requires careful planning.\n\nWhich one you choose?",
