	 Congratulations on your new furry family member! Training a puppy requires patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement. Here are a few options to consider:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. **Positive Reinforcement Training**: This method focuses on rewarding good behavior with treats, praise, and affection. It's a gentle and effective approach that helps build trust between you and your puppy.\\ \tt 2. **Clicker Training**: This technique uses a small device that makes a "click" sound to mark good behavior, followed by a reward. It's a fun and engaging way to teach your puppy new tricks.\\ \tt 3. **Operant Conditioning**: This method uses consequences, such as treats or time-outs, to teach your puppy what is and isn't acceptable behavior. It's a more structured approach that requires careful planning.\\ \tt \\ \tt Which one you choose?
