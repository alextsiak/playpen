They were loud, they were messy, and they had a tendency to eat each other. But, alas, their demise was not just a result of their own bad behavior. Here are the top reasons why they went extinct:\\ \tt \\ \tt * This is bullet 1: They were just too cool for school. I mean, who needs to be the smartest species around when you can just be the biggest?\\ \tt * This is bullet 2: Their fashion sense was questionable. I mean, who thought it was a good idea to wear a frill on your head?\\ \tt * This is bullet 3: They were a bit too fond of the whole 'eating each other' thing. It's just not sustainable, folks.\\ \tt * This is bullet 4: Their love of karaoke was unmatched. Who needs a voice when you can just roar?\\ \tt * This is bullet 5: They were a bit too reliant on the 'dino-mite' method of transportation. I mean, who needs roads when you can just stomp on things?\\ \tt * This is bullet 6: Their obsession with shiny objects was just too much. I mean, who needs a functioning society when you can just collect rocks?\\ \tt * This is bullet 7: They were a bit too fond of the whole 'dino- drama' thing. I mean, who needs peace and harmony when you can just have a good old-fashioned dinosaur soap opera?\\ \tt * This is bullet 8: And finally, they just couldn't handle the pressure of being the center of attention. I mean, who needs to be the star of the show when you can just be a footnote in history?"
