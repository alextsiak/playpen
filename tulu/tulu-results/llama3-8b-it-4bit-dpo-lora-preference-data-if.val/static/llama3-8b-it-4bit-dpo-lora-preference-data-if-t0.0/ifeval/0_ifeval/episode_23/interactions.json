My neighbor, Old Tom, approached me, a gentle smile on his face.\n\n\"Good morning, young man,\" he said, his voice low and soothing.\n\n\"Good morning, Tom,\" I replied, taking a sip of my coffee.\n\nWe sat in comfortable silence for a moment, watching the world wake up. Then Tom spoke up.\n\n\"Beautiful day, isn't it?\" he said, his eyes scanning the horizon.\n\nI nodded, not wanting to break the spell. \"Yes, it's a great day.\"\n\nTom leaned back in his chair, his eyes squinting against the sun. \"You know, I've been thinking about my garden. I need to get some new soil in.\"\n\n\"Ah, good idea,\" I said, nodding. \"Fresh soil will do wonders for your plants.\"\n\nTom nodded, his face thoughtful. \"Yes, I think you're right. I'll get some tomorrow.\"\n\nWe sat in silence for a moment, the only sound the chirping of birds. Then Tom spoke up.\n\n\"You know, I've been meaning to ask you something. How's your brother doing?\"\n\nI smiled, thinking of my brother. \"He's doing well, thanks for asking. He's been busy with work.\"\n\nTom nodded, his face sympathetic. \"Good, good. I'm glad to hear that.\"\n\nWe sat in comfortable silence for a moment, watching the world go by. Then I stood up, finishing my coffee.\n\n\"Well, Tom, it was good talking to you,\" I said, smiling.\n\n\"Likewise, young man,\" he replied, standing up to walk with me to the door.\n\nI smiled, feeling grateful for the conversation. \"Thanks for the chat, Tom.\"\n\nHe nodded, his face smiling. \"Anytime, my friend.\"",
