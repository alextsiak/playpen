On day one, the students will embark on a thrilling adventure, starting with a 6:00 AM breakfast feast featuring an endless array of pancakes, waffles, and eggs. The morning will be filled with a series of trust-building exercises, including a giant game of capture the flag, a scavenger hunt, and a round of \"dodge the foam pit.\" Don't worry, the foam pit is designed to be a safe and hilarious way to get those endorphins pumping. After all that excitement, the students will be treated to a leisurely stroll around the campus, where they'll get to admire the beautiful architecture and maybe even spot a few squirrels.\n\n*** \n\nThe afternoon will be a time for creativity and self-expression. Students will have the opportunity to participate in a series of wacky workshops, including a class on extreme hula hooping, a session on the art of making the perfect grilled cheese sandwich, and a workshop on the ancient art of burrito wrapping. Yes, you read that right – burrito wrapping! It's a skill that requires finesse, patience, and a willingness to get a little messy. After all the creative chaos, the students will be treated to a catered dinner featuring a menu of international cuisine, including tacos, pizza, and (you guessed it) more grilled cheese sandwiches.\n\n*** \n\nDay two will be all about competition and teamwork. The students will be divided into teams and participate in a series of absurd challenges, including a giant water balloon toss, a round of \"musical chairs\" played on a giant inflatable obstacle course, and a game of \"Simon Says\" with a twist. The winning team will receive a prize, but let's be real – the real prize is the bragging rights and the memories that will last a lifetime. After all the competition, the students will be treated to a relaxing evening of stargazing, complete with a DIY s'mores bar and a screening of a classic comedy movie.\n\n*** \n\nOn the final day, the students will embark on a series of thrilling adventures, including a visit to the world-famous arboretum, a hike through the nearby hills, and a round of \"geocaching\" – a real-life treasure hunt! The day will culminate in a farewell feast featuring a menu of student-favorite foods, including (you guessed it) more grilled cheese sandwiches. It's been a wild ride, but all good things must come to an end. The students will depart with memories, new friends, and a newfound appreciation for the art of burrito wrapping. Until next time, stay silly!<|eot_id|>",
