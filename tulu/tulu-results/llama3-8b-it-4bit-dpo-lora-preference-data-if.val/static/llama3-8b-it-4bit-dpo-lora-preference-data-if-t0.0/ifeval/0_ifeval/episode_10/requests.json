Task Summary\nImplement a user authentication system for the company's web application.\n***\nPart 2. Motivation\nThe current web application lacks a robust user authentication system, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access. Implementing a secure authentication system is crucial to protect user data and ensure compliance with industry standards. This task aims to enhance the application's security features, improve user experience, and provide a seamless login process.\n***\nPart 3. Milestone objectives\n1. Integrate a secure authentication library into the application.\n2. Design a user-friendly login interface.\n3. Implement password hashing and salting for secure password storage.\n4. Develop a forgot password feature with email verification.\n5. Conduct thorough testing to ensure the authentication system's reliability.\n\nMilestone objectives:\n- Integrate library: Complete the integration of the authentication library into the application.\n- Design interface: Design a visually appealing and user-friendly login interface.\n- Hash and salt: Implement password hashing and salting for secure password storage.\n- Forgot password: Develop a forgot password feature with email verification.\n- Testing: Conduct thorough testing to ensure the authentication system's reliability.\n\n***\nPart 4. Timeline\nThe task is expected to be completed within 4 weeks. The timeline is broken down into the following milestones:\n\nWeek 1: Research and integration of the authentication library.\nWeek 2: Design and development of the login interface.\nWeek 3: Implementation of password hashing and salting, and forgot password feature.\nWeek 4: Thorough testing and deployment of the authentication system.\n\n***\nPart 5.
