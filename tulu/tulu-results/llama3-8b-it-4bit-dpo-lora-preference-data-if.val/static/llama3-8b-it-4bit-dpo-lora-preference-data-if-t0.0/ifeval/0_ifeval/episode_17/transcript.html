    <div speaker="Player 1 (InstructionFollower) to GM (Game Master)" class="msg a-gm" style="">
        <p>&quot;Let&#x27;s break this down step by step.<br/><br/>1. The Jimenez family has 20 members, and each member has at least one pet. This means the total number of pets is 32.<br/><br/>2. To find the maximum number of members that can possibly have 3 pets, we need to consider the scenario where the remaining members have the minimum number of pets, which is 1.<br/><br/>3. If 17 members have 1 pet each, the total number of pets from these members would be 17.<br/><br/>4. This leaves us with 32 - 17 = 15 pets that can be distributed among the remaining members.<br/><br/>5. Since we want to maximize the number of members with 3 pets, we should minimize the number of members with 2 pets. Let&#x27;s assume x members have 2 pets each. Then, the total number of pets from these members would be 2x.<br/><br/>6. We know that the total number of pets from members with 2 pets and 3 pets should be 15. So, we can set up the equation 2x + 3y = 15, where y is the number of members with 3 pets.<br/><br/>7. Since we want to maximize y, we should minimize x. The minimum value of x is 0, but that would mean all 15 pets are with members who have 3 pets, which is not possible since there are only 20 members in total. So, let&#x27;s try x = 1.<br/><br/>8. If x = 1, then 2x = 2. This means 2 pets are with 1 member, and the remaining 13 pets are with members who have 3 pets. <br/><br/>9. Now, we can solve for y: 2 + 3y = 15. Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us 3y = 13. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us y = 13/3.<br/><br/>10. However, y must be an integer, so we need to adjust our previous assumption. Let&#x27;s try x = 0.<br/><br/>11. If x = 0, then all 15 pets are with members who have 3 pets. This means 15 members have 3 pets each.<br/><br/>12. However, this would mean the total number of pets is 15 * 3 = 45, which is not possible since there are only 32 pets in total.<br/><br/>13. Let&#x27;s try x = 1, but this time, let&#x27;s adjust the number of members with 3 pets. If x = 1, then 2 pets are with 1 member, and the remaining 14 pets are with members who have 3 pets.<br/><br/>14. Now, we can solve for y: 2 + 3y = 14. Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us 3y = 12. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us y = 4.<br/><br/>15. Therefore, the maximum number of members that can possibly have 3 pets is &#x27;4&#x27;.&quot;</p>
