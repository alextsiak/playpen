The use of \"begabt\" to describe someone's intelligence is somewhat colloquial and might not be the most precise choice. A more formal or nuanced way to express the idea could be to say \"aber nicht sehr aufgeklärt\" or \"aber nicht sehr verständig\", which convey a similar meaning without using the word \"begabt\". \n\nHowever, in everyday conversation, the sentence is clear and effectively conveys the intended meaning. \n\nIf you want to avoid the word \"begabt\" altogether, you could rephrase the sentence to something like:\n\nWerner war ein guter Freund von mir, aber nicht sehr präzise in seinen Urteilen.\n\nThis version maintains the same meaning while using different vocabulary. \n\nKeep in mind that the criticism is aimed at the original sentence, and the translation provided is a direct equivalent. If you're looking for a more idiomatic or nuanced translation, I'd be happy to help with that as well.<|eot_id|>",
