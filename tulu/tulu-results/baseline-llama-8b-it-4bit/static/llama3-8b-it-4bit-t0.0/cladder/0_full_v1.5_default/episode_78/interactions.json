The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Wibl has a direct effect on vubr and zuph. Zuph has a direct effect on uvzi. Vubr has a direct effect on uvzi. For those who are not wibl and are not zuph, the probability of uvzi is 77%. For those who are not wibl and are zuph, the probability of uvzi is 63%. For those who are wibl and are not zuph, the probability of uvzi is 54%. For those who are wibl and are zuph, the probability of uvzi is 76%. The overall probability of wibl is 23%. Will zuph increase the chance of uvzi?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

We have the following probabilities:\n\n- P(uvzi | not wibl, not zuph) = 77%\n- P(uvzi | not wibl, zuph) = 63%\n- P(uvzi | wibl, not zuph) = 54%\n- P(uvzi | wibl, zuph) = 76%\n\nWe are also given that the overall probability of wibl is 23%. \n\nTo assess the effect of zuph on uvzi, we can use the concept of causal mediation analysis. We can calculate the average causal effect of zuph on uvzi by considering the probabilities of uvzi in different subgroups.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the probability of uvzi in the subgroup of people who are not wibl and not zuph. This is already given as 77%.\n\nNext, let's calculate the probability of uvzi in the subgroup of people who are not wibl and zuph. We can use the law of total probability to do this:\n\nP(uvzi | not wibl) = P(uvzi | not wibl, zuph) * P(zuph | not wibl) + P(uvzi | not wibl,",
