Let's denote the variables as follows:\n\n- S: Smoking (1 = smoker, 0 = nonsmoker)\n- E: Effort (1 = high effort, 0 = low effort)\n- A: College admission (1 = admitted, 0 = not admitted)\n\nGiven the information:\n\n- P(A|E=1, S=0) = 67% (probability of admission for nonsmokers with high effort)\n- P(A|E=1, S=1) = 55% (probability of admission for smokers with high effort)\n\nWe are asked to compare the probability of admission for smokers with high effort to the probability of admission for nonsmokers with high effort. However, the given information does not directly provide this comparison.\n\nTo answer the question, we need to consider the potential effect of smoking on effort. If smoking reduces effort, then the probability of admission for smokers with high effort would be lower than the probability of admission for nonsmokers with high effort. However, the given information does not provide any direct evidence of this relationship.\n\nOne possible interpretation is that smoking has a direct negative effect on effort, which in turn reduces the probability of admission. If this is the case, then the probability of admission for smokers with high effort would be lower than the probability of admission for nonsmokers with high effort.\n\nHowever, the given information",
