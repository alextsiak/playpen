The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and brown eyes. Studying habit has a direct effect on brown eyes. The overall probability of encouragement is 91%. The probability of discouragement and brown eyes is 7%. The probability of encouragement and brown eyes is 58%. Is the chance of brown eyes larger when observing encouragement?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Let's denote the following events:\n\n- E: Encouragement\n- D: Discouragement\n- B: Brown eyes\n- S: Studying habit\n\nGiven information:\n\n- P(E) = 0.91 (probability of encouragement)\n- P(D and B) = 0.07 (probability of discouragement and brown eyes)\n- P(E and B) = 0.58 (probability of encouragement and brown eyes)\n\nWe are interested in comparing the probability of brown eyes given encouragement (P(B|E)) with the overall probability of brown eyes (P(B)).\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of brown eyes given discouragement (P(B|D)). Since P(D and B) = 0.07 and P(D) = 1 - P(E) = 1 - 0.91 = 0.09, we can find P(B|D) as follows:\n\nP(B|D) = P(D and B) / P(D) = 0.07 / 0.09 = 0.78\n\nNow, we can use the law of total probability to find the overall probability of brown eyes (P(B)):\n\nP(B) = P(B|E) * P(E) + P(B|D) * P(D)\n= P(B|",
