	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and brown eyes. Studying habit has a direct effect on brown eyes. The overall probability of encouragement is 91%. The probability of discouragement and brown eyes is 7%. The probability of encouragement and brown eyes is 58%. Is the chance of brown eyes larger when observing encouragement?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, the chance of brown eyes is not larger when observing encouragement.\\ \tt \\ \tt To analyze this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability and the rules of probability. Let's denote the following events:\\ \tt \\ \tt - E: Encouragement\\ \tt - D: Discouragement\\ \tt - B: Brown eyes\\ \tt - S: Studying habit\\ \tt \\ \tt Given information:\\ \tt \\ \tt - P(E) = 0.91 (probability of encouragement)\\ \tt - P(D and B) = 0.07 (probability of discouragement and brown eyes)\\ \tt - P(E and B) = 0.58 (probability of encouragement and brown eyes)\\ \tt \\ \tt We are interested in comparing the probability of brown eyes given encouragement (P(B|E)) with the overall probability of brown eyes (P(B)).\\ \tt \\ \tt First, let's find the probability of brown eyes given discouragement (P(B|D)). Since P(D and B) = 0.07 and P(D) = 1 - P(E) = 1 - 0.91 = 0.09, we can find P(B|D) as follows:\\ \tt \\ \tt P(B|D) = P(D and B) / P(D) = 0.07 / 0.09 = 0.78\\ \tt \\ \tt Now, we can use the law of total probability to find the overall probability of brown eyes (P(B)):\\ \tt \\ \tt P(B) = P(B|E) * P(E) + P(B|D) * P(D)\\ \tt = P(B|
