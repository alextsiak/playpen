The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on having a sister and cholesterol level. Treatment assignment has a direct effect on having a sister. Having a sister has a direct effect on cholesterol level. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of having a sister is 20%. The probability of not having a sister and low cholesterol is 65%. The probability of having a sister and low cholesterol is 14%. Is the chance of low cholesterol larger when observing having a sister?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Unobserved confounders have a direct effect on having a sister and cholesterol level.\n2. Treatment assignment has a direct effect on having a sister.\n3. Having a sister has a direct effect on cholesterol level.\n4. The overall probability of having a sister is 20%.\n5. The probability of not having a sister and low cholesterol is 65%.\n6. The probability of having a sister and low cholesterol is 14%.\n\nWe are asked to compare the probability of low cholesterol when observing having a sister versus not having a sister. To do this, we need to consider the potential outcomes framework, which involves the following:\n\n- The probability of low cholesterol when not having a sister (P(Low Cholesterol | No Sister))\n- The probability of low cholesterol when having a sister (P(Low Cholesterol | Sister))\n\nUsing the given probabilities, we can calculate the probability of low cholesterol when not having a sister as follows:\n\nP(Low Cholesterol | No Sister) = P(No Sister and Low Cholesterol) / P(No Sister)\n= 65% / (100% - 20%)\n= 65% / 80%\n= 0.8125\n\nNow, let's consider the probability of low cholesterol when having a sister.
