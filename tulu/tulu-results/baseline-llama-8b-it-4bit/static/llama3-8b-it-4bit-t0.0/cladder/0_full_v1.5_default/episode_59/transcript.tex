	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on having a sister and cholesterol level. Treatment assignment has a direct effect on having a sister. Having a sister has a direct effect on cholesterol level. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of having a sister is 20%. The probability of not having a sister and low cholesterol is 65%. The probability of having a sister and low cholesterol is 14%. Is the chance of low cholesterol larger when observing having a sister?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No.\\ \tt \\ \tt To address this question, we need to apply the principles of causal inference, specifically the concept of confounding variables and the potential outcomes framework. \\ \tt \\ \tt Let's break down the given information:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Unobserved confounders have a direct effect on having a sister and cholesterol level.\\ \tt 2. Treatment assignment has a direct effect on having a sister.\\ \tt 3. Having a sister has a direct effect on cholesterol level.\\ \tt 4. The overall probability of having a sister is 20%.\\ \tt 5. The probability of not having a sister and low cholesterol is 65%.\\ \tt 6. The probability of having a sister and low cholesterol is 14%.\\ \tt \\ \tt We are asked to compare the probability of low cholesterol when observing having a sister versus not having a sister. To do this, we need to consider the potential outcomes framework, which involves the following:\\ \tt \\ \tt - The probability of low cholesterol when not having a sister (P(Low Cholesterol | No Sister))\\ \tt - The probability of low cholesterol when having a sister (P(Low Cholesterol | Sister))\\ \tt \\ \tt Using the given probabilities, we can calculate the probability of low cholesterol when not having a sister as follows:\\ \tt \\ \tt P(Low Cholesterol | No Sister) = P(No Sister and Low Cholesterol) / P(No Sister)\\ \tt = 65% / (100% - 20%)\\ \tt = 65% / 80%\\ \tt = 0.8125\\ \tt \\ \tt Now, let's consider the probability of low cholesterol when having a sister. We can use the
