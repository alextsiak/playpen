Let's denote the variables as follows:\n\n- S: Smoking (smoker = 1, nonsmoker = 0)\n- E: Effort (high effort = 1, low effort = 0)\n- A: College admission (admitted = 1, not admitted = 0)\n\nGiven the information:\n\n- P(A = 1 | S = 0) = 76% (probability of college admission for nonsmokers)\n- P(A = 1 | S = 1) = 22% (probability of college admission for smokers)\n\nWe can infer the following relationships:\n\n- Smoking (S) has a direct effect on effort (E) and college admission (A).\n- Effort (E) has a direct effect on college admission (A).\n\nNow, let's consider the counterfactual scenario: \"For smokers, would it be less likely to see college admission if the student had been a nonsmoker?\"\n\nTo answer this question, we need to compare the probability of college admission for smokers (S = 1) with the probability of college admission for nonsmokers (S = 0), assuming the effort level remains the same. However, the given information does not provide a direct comparison of effort levels between smokers and nonsmokers.\n\nSince the effort level is not explicitly mentioned for smokers and nonsmokers, we cannot",
