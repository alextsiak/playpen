Hwax has a direct effect on lirg. The overall probability of jyka is 14%. For those who are not jyka, the probability of lirg is 71%. For those who are jyka, the probability of lirg is 66%. Is lirg less likely than not lirg overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

P(J = 1) = 0.14 (the probability of being Jyka is 14%)\n2. P(L = 1 | J = 0) = 0.71 (for those who are not Jyka, the probability of Lirg is 71%)\n3. P(L = 1 | J = 1) = 0.66 (for those who are Jyka, the probability of Lirg is 66%)\n\nWe want to determine whether Lirg is less likely than not Lirg overall, which is equivalent to asking whether P(L = 1) < 0.5.\n\nTo calculate the overall probability of Lirg, we can use the law of total probability:\n\nP(L = 1) = P(L = 1 | J = 1) \\* P(J = 1) + P(L = 1 | J = 0) \\* P(J = 0)\n\nWe know P",
