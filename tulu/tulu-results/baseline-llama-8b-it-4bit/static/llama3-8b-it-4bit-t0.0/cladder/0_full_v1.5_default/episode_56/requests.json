Going to the beach has a direct effect on black hair. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 99%. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of black hair is 66%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of black hair is 24%.

Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on black hair.\n2. Going to the beach has a direct effect on black hair.\n3. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 99%.\n4. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of black hair is 66%.\n5. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of black hair is 24%.\n\nWe can infer that the primary cause of black hair in this world is not the tanning salon treatment itself, but rather the fact that people who go to tanning salons are also more likely to go to the beach, which directly affects the probability of black hair. This is because the probability of black hair is 66% for people not using tanning salon treatments, but only 24% for people who use tanning salon treatments. This suggests that the tanning salon treatment is a proxy for the beach-going behavior, which is the actual cause of black hair.\n\nTo calculate the overall probability of black hair, we need to consider both the probability of tanning salon treatment and the probability of black hair for people who do not use tanning salon treatments. Since the probability of tanning salon treatment is 99%, the probability of not using tanning salon treatment is 1%.\n\nLet's assume the probability of black hair for people who do not use",
