The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and foot size. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on foot size. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 47%. The probability of high school degree or lower and large feet is 32%. The probability of college degree or higher and large feet is 10%. Is the chance of large feet smaller when observing college degree or higher?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Unobserved confounders have a direct effect on both education level and foot size.\n2. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level.\n3. Education level has a direct effect on foot size.\n4. The overall probability of a college degree or higher is 47%.\n5. The probability of a high school degree or lower and large feet is 32%.\n6. The probability of a college degree or higher and large feet is 10%.\n\nWe can use the potential outcomes framework to analyze this problem. Let's define the following variables:\n\n- U: Unobserved confounders\n- E: Education level\n- F: Foot size\n- C: College degree or higher (binary variable, 1 if college degree or higher, 0 otherwise)\n\nWe can represent the relationships between these variables as follows:\n\n- P(F|U) = P(F|E) (the effect of U on F is mediated by E)\n- P(E|U) = P(E|C) (the effect of U on E is mediated by C)\n- P(F|E) = P(F|E=high)P(E=high|C) + P(F|E=low)P(E=low|C) (the effect of E on F is mediated by C)\n\nUsing the given",
