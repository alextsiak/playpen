Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on foot size. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. The overall probability of college degree or higher is 47%. The probability of high school degree or lower and large feet is 32%. The probability of college degree or higher and large feet is 10%.

Unobserved confounders have a direct effect on both education level and foot size.\n2. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level.\n3. Education level has a direct effect on foot size.\n4. The overall probability of a college degree or higher is 47%.\n5. The probability of a high school degree or lower and large feet is 32%.\n6. The probability of a college degree or higher and large feet is 10%.\n\nWe can use the potential outcomes framework to analyze this problem. Let's define the following variables:\n\n- U: Unobserved confounders\n- E: Education level\n- F: Foot size\n- C: College degree or higher (binary variable, 1 if college degree or higher, 0 otherwise)\n\nWe can represent the relationships between these variables as follows:\n\n- P(F|U) = P(F|E) (the effect of U on F is mediated by E)\n- P(E|U) = P(E|C) (the effect of U on E is mediated by C)\n- P(F|E) = P(F|E=high)P(E=high|C) + P(F|E=low)P(E=low|C) (the effect of E on F is mediated by C)\n\nUsing the given",
