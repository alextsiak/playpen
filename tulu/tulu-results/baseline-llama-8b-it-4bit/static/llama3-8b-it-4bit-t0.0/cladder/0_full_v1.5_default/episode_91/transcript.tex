	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Jyka has a direct effect on zory and zuph. Zuph has a direct effect on glimx. Zory has a direct effect on glimx. The overall probability of zuph is 34%. The probability of not zuph and glimx is 64%. The probability of zuph and glimx is 28%. Is the chance of glimx smaller when observing zuph?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, the chance of glimx is not smaller when observing zuph.\\ \tt \\ \tt To analyze this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability. Let's define the following events:\\ \tt \\ \tt - Z: Zuph\\ \tt - G: Glimx\\ \tt - J: Jyka\\ \tt \\ \tt We are given the following probabilities:\\ \tt \\ \tt - P(Z) = 34% (probability of zuph)\\ \tt - P(¬Z ∧ G) = 64% (probability of not zuph and glimx)\\ \tt - P(Z ∧ G) = 28% (probability of zuph and glimx)\\ \tt \\ \tt We want to determine if the probability of G (glimx) is smaller when observing Z (zuph). To do this, we can use the formula for conditional probability:\\ \tt \\ \tt P(G|Z) = P(Z ∧ G) / P(Z)\\ \tt \\ \tt We can also use the law of total probability to find P(G|Z):\\ \tt \\ \tt P(G|Z) = P(Z ∧ G) / P(Z) = 28% / 34% ≈ 0.8235\\ \tt \\ \tt Now, let's find the probability of G (glimx) without the condition Z (zuph):\\ \tt \\ \tt P(G) = P(¬Z ∧ G) + P(Z ∧ G) = 64% + 28% = 92%\\ \tt \\ \tt We can also find the probability of G (glimx) given the condition ¬Z (not zuph):
