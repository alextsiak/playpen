Zuph has a direct effect on glimx. Zory has a direct effect on glimx. The overall probability of zuph is 34%. The probability of not zuph and glimx is 64%. The probability of zuph and glimx is 28%. Is the chance of glimx smaller when observing zuph?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Let's define the following events:\n\n- Z: Zuph\n- G: Glimx\n- J: Jyka\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n\n- P(Z) = 34% (probability of zuph)\n- P(¬Z ∧ G) = 64% (probability of not zuph and glimx)\n- P(Z ∧ G) = 28% (probability of zuph and glimx)\n\nWe want to determine if the probability of G (glimx) is smaller when observing Z (zuph). To do this, we can use the formula for conditional probability:\n\nP(G|Z) = P(Z ∧ G) / P(Z)\n\nWe can also use the law of total probability to find P(G|Z):\n\nP(G|Z) = P(Z ∧ G) / P(Z) = 28% / 34% ≈ 0.8235\n\nNow, let's find the probability of G (glimx) without the condition Z (zuph):\n\nP(G) = P(¬Z ∧ G) + P(Z ∧ G) = 64% + 28% = 92%\n\nWe can also find the probability of G (glimx) given the condition ¬Z (not zuph):\n\n",
