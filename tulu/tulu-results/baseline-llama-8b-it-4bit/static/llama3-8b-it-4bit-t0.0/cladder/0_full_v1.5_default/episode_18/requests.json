Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. The overall probability of manager signing the termination letter is 35%. For managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 76%. For managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 42%.

The probability of a manager signing the termination letter is 35%.\n2. For managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 76%.\n3. For managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 42%.\n\nWe can calculate the overall probability of employee being fired as follows:\n\n- Probability of manager signing the termination letter and employee being fired: 0.35 * 0.42 = 0.147\n- Probability of manager not signing the termination letter and employee being fired: 0.65 * 0.76 = 0.494\n- Total probability of employee being fired: 0.147 + 0.494 = 0.641\n\nHowever, to determine if employee being fired is more likely than employee not being fired overall, we need to compare the probability of employee being fired to the probability of employee not being fired.\n\n- Probability of employee not being fired: 1 - 0.641 = 0.359\n\nSince 0.359 (probability of employee not being fired) is greater than 0.641 (probability of employee being fired), employee being fired is not more likely than employee not being fired overall.\n\nThis result might seem counterintuitive at first, but it's due to the fact that the probability of a manager signing the",
