	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Full moon has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. The overall probability of full moon is 31%. The probability of no full moon and wet ground is 33%. The probability of full moon and wet ground is 19%. Is the chance of wet ground smaller when observing full moon?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, the chance of wet ground is not smaller when observing full moon.\\ \tt \\ \tt To analyze this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability and the causal relationships between the variables. Let's denote the variables as follows:\\ \tt \\ \tt - F: Full moon (F = 1 if full moon, F = 0 if no full moon)\\ \tt - S: Sprinkler (S = 1 if sprinkler is on, S = 0 if sprinkler is off)\\ \tt - W: Wet ground (W = 1 if ground is wet, W = 0 if ground is dry)\\ \tt \\ \tt Given the causal relationships:\\ \tt \\ \tt - F → S (Full moon has a direct effect on sprinkler)\\ \tt - F → W (Full moon has a direct effect on weather)\\ \tt - W → S (Weather has a direct effect on sprinkler)\\ \tt - S → W (Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground)\\ \tt \\ \tt We are given the following probabilities:\\ \tt \\ \tt - P(F = 1) = 0.31 (probability of full moon)\\ \tt - P(F = 0, W = 1) = 0.33 (probability of no full moon and wet ground)\\ \tt - P(F = 1, W = 1) = 0.19 (probability of full moon and wet ground)\\ \tt \\ \tt We want to determine if the chance of wet ground (W = 1) is smaller when observing full moon (F = 1). To do this, we can calculate the probability of wet ground given
