	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Xevo has a direct effect on tijw and tijv. Tijv has a direct effect on gyzp. Tijw has a direct effect on gyzp. The overall probability of xevo is 48%. For those who are not xevo, the probability of gyzp is 39%. For those who are xevo, the probability of gyzp is 78%. Is gyzp more likely than not gyzp overall?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, gyzp is not more likely than not gyzp overall.\\ \tt \\ \tt To understand this, we need to apply the principles of causal inference, specifically the concept of conditional probabilities and the potential outcome (PO) framework. \\ \tt \\ \tt First, let's define the variables and their relationships:\\ \tt \\ \tt - Xevo (X) has a direct effect on Tijw (W) and Tijv (V).\\ \tt - Tijv (V) has a direct effect on Gyzp (Y).\\ \tt - Tijw (W) has a direct effect on Gyzp (Y).\\ \tt \\ \tt We are given the following probabilities:\\ \tt \\ \tt - P(X) = 0.48 (the overall probability of Xevo)\\ \tt - P(Y|~X) = 0.39 (the probability of Gyzp for those who are not Xevo)\\ \tt - P(Y|X) = 0.78 (the probability of Gyzp for those who are Xevo)\\ \tt \\ \tt To determine whether Gyzp is more likely than not Gyzp overall, we need to calculate the overall probability of Gyzp, P(Y). We can do this using the law of total probability:\\ \tt \\ \tt P(Y) = P(Y|X) \* P(X) + P(Y|~X) \* P(~X)\\ \tt \\ \tt Since P(~X) = 1 - P(X) = 1 - 0.48 = 0.52, we can substitute the given values:\\ \tt \\ \tt P
