	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Season has a direct effect on sprinkler and weather. Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. The overall probability of rainy season is 87%. The probability of dry season and wet ground is 7%. The probability of rainy season and wet ground is 50%. Is the chance of wet ground larger when observing rainy season?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 Yes, the chance of wet ground is larger when observing rainy season.\\ \tt \\ \tt To answer this question, we need to apply the principles of causal inference, specifically the concept of conditional probability and the potential outcome (PO) framework. \\ \tt \\ \tt First, let's define the variables and their relationships:\\ \tt \\ \tt - Let S be the season (rainy or dry)\\ \tt - Let W be the weather (rainy or dry)\\ \tt - Let G be the ground (wet or dry)\\ \tt - Let S → W be the direct effect of season on weather\\ \tt - Let W → G be the direct effect of weather on ground\\ \tt - Let S → G be the direct effect of season on ground\\ \tt \\ \tt Given the probabilities:\\ \tt \\ \tt - P(S = rainy) = 87%\\ \tt - P(S = dry, G = wet) = 7%\\ \tt - P(S = rainy, G = wet) = 50%\\ \tt \\ \tt We want to compare the probability of wet ground (G = wet) when observing rainy season (S = rainy) to the probability of wet ground when observing dry season (S = dry).\\ \tt \\ \tt Using the PO framework, we can write the following equations:\\ \tt \\ \tt - P(G = wet | S = rainy) = P(G = wet | S = rainy, W = rainy) \* P(W = rainy | S = rainy) + P(G = wet | S = rainy, W = dry) \* P(W = dry | S = rainy)\\ \tt - P(G = wet | S = dry) = P(G =
