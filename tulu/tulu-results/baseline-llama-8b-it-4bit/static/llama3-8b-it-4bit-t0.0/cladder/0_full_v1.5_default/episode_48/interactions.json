The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Listening to jazz has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For people who do not listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 61%. For people who listen to jazz, the probability of lung cancer is 79%. For people who listen to jazz, would it be less likely to see lung cancer if the person did not listen to jazz?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Let's denote the variables as follows:\n\n- J: Listening to jazz\n- T: Tar deposit\n- L: Lung cancer\n\nGiven the information:\n\n1. J → T (Listening to jazz has a direct effect on tar deposit)\n2. T → L (Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer)\n3. P(L|J) = 79% (Probability of lung cancer given that the person listens to jazz)\n4. P(L|J') = 61% (Probability of lung cancer given that the person does not listen to jazz)\n\nWe are asked to compare the probability of lung cancer if a person who listens to jazz did not listen to jazz. This is equivalent to comparing P(L|J,T') and P(L|J').\n\nUsing the law of total probability, we can write:\n\nP(L|J,T') = P(L|J')P(T'|J) + P(L|J,T')P(T|J)\n\nHowever, we do not have the conditional probabilities P(T'|J) and P(T|J). But we can use the fact that P(L|J) = P(L|J,T)P(T|J) + P(L|J,T')P(T'|J) to derive the following equation:\n\nP(L|J) = P(L|J,T)P(T|J) + P(L|J,T')P",
