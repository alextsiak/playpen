Let's denote the variables as follows:\n\n- J: Listening to jazz\n- T: Tar deposit\n- L: Lung cancer\n\nGiven the information:\n\n1. J → T (Listening to jazz has a direct effect on tar deposit)\n2. T → L (Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer)\n3. P(L|J) = 79% (Probability of lung cancer given that the person listens to jazz)\n4. P(L|J') = 61% (Probability of lung cancer given that the person does not listen to jazz)\n\nWe are asked to compare the probability of lung cancer if a person who listens to jazz did not listen to jazz. This is equivalent to comparing P(L|J,T') and P(L|J').\n\nUsing the law of total probability, we can write:\n\nP(L|J,T') = P(L|J')P(T'|J) + P(L|J,T')P(T|J)\n\nHowever, we do not have the conditional probabilities P(T'|J) and P(T|J). But we can use the fact that P(L|J) = P(L|J,T)P(T|J) + P(L|J,T')P(T'|J) to derive the following equation:\n\nP(L|J) = P(L|J,T)P(T|J) + P(L|J,T')P",
