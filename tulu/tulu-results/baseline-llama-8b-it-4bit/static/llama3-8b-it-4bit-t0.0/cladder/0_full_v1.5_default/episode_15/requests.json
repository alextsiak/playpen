This is essentially asking whether the probability of a ringing alarm is lower when the husband sets the alarm compared to when he doesn't set the alarm.\n\nTo answer this, we can use the concept of conditional probabilities. Let's define two events:\n\n- A: The husband sets the alarm.\n- B: The alarm rings.\n\nWe are given the following conditional probabilities:\n\n- P(B|A) = 0.32 (probability of alarm ringing given that the husband sets the alarm)\n- P(B|A') = 0.78 (probability of alarm ringing given that the husband does not set the alarm)\n\nWe want to compare P(B|A) and P(B|A'). However, we are not directly given P(B|A') in terms of P(A|B) and P(B). But we can use the law of total probability to find P(B) in terms of P(A) and P(B|A) and P(B|A').\n\nHowever, we can use the fact that P(B) = P",
