The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Zory has a direct effect on zuph and glimx. Zuph has a direct effect on jyka. Jyka has a direct effect on glimx. Zory is unobserved. The overall probability of zuph is 8%. The probability of not zuph and glimx is 58%. The probability of zuph and glimx is 1%. Is the chance of glimx smaller when observing zuph?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Let's denote the probability of zuph as P(Z), the probability of glimx as P(G), and the probability of both zuph and glimx as P(Z ∩ G). We are given the following probabilities:\n\n- P(Z) = 8% (probability of zuph)\n- P(¬Z ∩ ¬G) = 58% (probability of not zuph and not glimx)\n- P(Z ∩ G) = 1% (probability of both zuph and glimx)\n\nWe can calculate the probability of not zuph and glimx as P(¬Z ∩ G) = P(G) - P(Z ∩ G) = P(G) - 0.01.\n\nWe are also given that Zory has a direct effect on zuph and glimx, and zuph has a direct effect on jyka, which in turn has a direct effect on glimx. This suggests a causal relationship between zuph and glimx, mediated by jyka.\n\nUsing the given probabilities, we can calculate the probability of glimx as follows:\n\nP(G) = P(¬Z ∩ ¬G) + P(¬Z ∩ G) + P(Z �",
