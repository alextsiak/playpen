The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Zory has a direct effect on zuph and glimx. Zuph has a direct effect on jyka. Jyka has a direct effect on glimx. Zory is unobserved. The overall probability of zuph is 8%. The probability of not zuph and glimx is 58%. The probability of zuph and glimx is 1%. Is the chance of glimx smaller when observing zuph?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Let's denote the probability of zuph as P(Z), the probability of glimx as P(G), and the probability of both zuph and glimx as P(Z ∩ G). We are given the following probabilities:\n\n- P(Z) = 8% (probability of zuph)\n- P(¬Z ∩ ¬G) = 58% (probability of not zuph and not glimx)\n- P(Z ∩ G) = 1% (probability of both zuph and glimx)\n\nWe can calculate the probability of not zuph and glimx as P(¬Z ∩ G) = P(G) - P(Z ∩ G) = P(G) - 0.01.\n\nWe are also given that Zory has a direct effect on zuph and glimx, and zuph has a direct effect on jyka, which in turn has a direct effect on glimx. This suggests a causal relationship between zuph and glimx, mediated by jyka.\n\nUsing the given probabilities, we can calculate the probability of glimx as follows:\n\nP(G) = P(¬Z ∩ ¬G) + P(¬Z ∩ G) + P(Z �",
