The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gwet has a direct effect on yomx and xevu. Yomx has a direct effect on xevu. The overall probability of yomx is 75%. The probability of not yomx and xevu is 22%. The probability of yomx and xevu is 56%. Is the chance of xevu smaller when observing yomx?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Let's denote the probability of xevu given yomx as P(xevu|yomx). We can use the law of total probability to calculate this conditional probability.\n\nGiven the probabilities:\n- P(yomx) = 0.75\n- P(not yomx and xevu) = 0.22\n- P(yomx and xevu) = 0.56\n\nWe can calculate the probability of xevu and not yomx as follows:\n- P(xevu and not yomx) = P(not yomx and xevu) = 0.22\n\nNow, we can use the law of total probability to calculate P(xevu|yomx):\nP(xevu|yomx) = P(xevu and yomx) / P(yomx)\n= 0.56 / 0.75\n= 0.7467 (approximately)\n\nThis is greater than the overall probability of xevu, which is not directly given but can be calculated as follows:\nP(xevu) = P(xevu and yomx) + P(xevu and not yomx)\n= 0.56 + 0.22\n= 0.78\n\nSince P(xevu",
