Yomx has a direct effect on xevu. The overall probability of yomx is 75%. The probability of not yomx and xevu is 22%. The probability of yomx and xevu is 56%. Is the chance of xevu smaller when observing yomx?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Let's denote the probability of xevu given yomx as P(xevu|yomx). We can use the law of total probability to calculate this conditional probability.\n\nGiven the probabilities:\n- P(yomx) = 0.75\n- P(not yomx and xevu) = 0.22\n- P(yomx and xevu) = 0.56\n\nWe can calculate the probability of xevu and not yomx as follows:\n- P(xevu and not yomx) = P(not yomx and xevu) = 0.22\n\nNow, we can use the law of total probability to calculate P(xevu|yomx):\nP(xevu|yomx) = P(xevu and yomx) / P(yomx)\n= 0.56 / 0.75\n= 0.7467 (approximately)\n\nThis is greater than the overall probability of xevu, which is not directly given but can be calculated as follows:\nP(xevu) = P(xevu and yomx) + P(xevu and not yomx)\n= 0.56 + 0.22\n= 0.78\n\nSince P(xevu",
