Let's denote the probability of xevu as P(xevu), the probability of rixq as P(rixq), and the probability of xevu given rixq as P(xevu | rixq).\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\n1. P(rixq) = 0.4\n2. P(not rixq and xevu) = 0.09\n3. P(rixq and xevu) = 0.22\n\nWe can use the law of total probability to find P(xevu):\n\nP(xevu) = P(xevu and rixq) + P(xevu and not rixq)\n= P(rixq and xevu) + P(not rixq and xevu)\n= 0.22 + 0.09\n= 0.31\n\nNow, we need to find P(xevu | rixq). We can use Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(xevu | rixq) = P(rixq and xevu) / P(rixq)\n= 0.22 / 0.4\n= 0.55\n\nComparing P(xevu) and P(xevu | rixq), we see that P(x",
