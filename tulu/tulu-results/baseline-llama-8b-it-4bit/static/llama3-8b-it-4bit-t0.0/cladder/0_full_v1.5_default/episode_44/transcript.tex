	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Ability to speak english has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes and lifespan. Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan. Smoking is unobserved. For people who do not speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 70%. For people who speak english, the probability of long lifespan is 38%. For people who speak english, would it be less likely to see long lifespan if the person did not speak english?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No.\\ \tt \\ \tt To address this question, we need to apply the principles of causal inference, specifically the concept of confounding variables and the potential outcome (PO) framework. \\ \tt \\ \tt In this hypothetical world, we have three variables: English speaking ability (E), smoking (S), diabetes (D), and lifespan (L). The relationships between these variables are as follows:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. E → D (English speaking ability has a direct effect on diabetes)\\ \tt 2. S → D (Smoking has a direct effect on diabetes)\\ \tt 3. D → L (Diabetes has a direct effect on lifespan)\\ \tt \\ \tt We are given the following probabilities:\\ \tt \\ \tt - P(L|E=0) = 0.7 (probability of long lifespan for people who do not speak English)\\ \tt - P(L|E=1) = 0.38 (probability of long lifespan for people who speak English)\\ \tt \\ \tt The question asks whether it would be less likely to see long lifespan if the person did not speak English, given that they speak English. This is a counterfactual question, which can be addressed using the PO framework.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's define the potential outcomes as follows:\\ \tt \\ \tt - L0: long lifespan\\ \tt - L1: short lifespan\\ \tt \\ \tt We want to compare the probability of long lifespan (L0) for people who do not speak English (E=0) with the probability of long lifespan (L0) for people who speak English (E=1), given that they speak English.\\ \tt \\ \tt Using the PO framework, we can
