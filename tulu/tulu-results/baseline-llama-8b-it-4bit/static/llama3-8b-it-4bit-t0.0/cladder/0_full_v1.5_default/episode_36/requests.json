Weather has a direct effect on ground. Sprinkler has a direct effect on ground. The overall probability of full moon is 16%. For situations where there is no full moon, the probability of wet ground is 56%. For situations where there is a full moon, the probability of wet ground is 54%. Is wet ground more likely than dry ground overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Let's break down the given information:\n\n1. The probability of a full moon is 16%.\n2. When there is no full moon, the probability of wet ground is 56%.\n3. When there is a full moon, the probability of wet ground is 54%.\n\nWe can calculate the overall probability of wet ground by considering two scenarios: with and without a full moon.\n\nScenario 1: Without a full moon (probability = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84)\n- Probability of wet ground = 0.84 * 0.56 = 0.4704\n- Probability of dry ground = 0.84 * (1 - 0.56) = 0.84 * 0.44 = 0.3696\n\nScenario 2: With a full moon (probability = 0.16)\n- Probability of wet ground = 0.16 * 0.54 = 0.0864\n- Probability of dry ground = 0.16 * (1 - 0.54) = 0.16 * 0.46 = 0.0736\n\nNow, let's calculate the overall probability of wet ground and dry ground:\n\n- Overall probability of wet ground = 0.4704 + 0.0864 = 0.556",
