	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Yupt has a direct effect on muvq. Zupj has a direct effect on muvq. We know that yupt or zupj causes muvq. We observed an individual is not zupj. Would an individual is muvq if yupt instead of not yupt?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No\\ \tt \\ \tt In this hypothetical world, we have two direct effects: Yupt → Muvq and Zupj → Muvq. We also know that Yupt or Zupj causes Muvq. This implies that Muvq is a common effect of both Yupt and Zupj.\\ \tt \\ \tt Given that the individual is not Zupj, we can infer that the causal effect of Zupj on Muvq is absent for this individual. However, the presence or absence of Yupt does not affect the causal relationship between Zupj and Muvq, as they are distinct causes.\\ \tt \\ \tt The question asks whether the individual would be Muvq if Yupt instead of not Yupt. Since the individual is not Zupj, the causal effect of Zupj on Muvq is absent. Even if Yupt is present, the individual would still not be Muvq because the causal effect of Zupj on Muvq is absent.\\ \tt \\ \tt In other words, the absence of Zupj is a sufficient condition for the individual not to be Muvq, regardless of the presence or absence of Yupt. Therefore, the individual would not be Muvq even if Yupt is present.
