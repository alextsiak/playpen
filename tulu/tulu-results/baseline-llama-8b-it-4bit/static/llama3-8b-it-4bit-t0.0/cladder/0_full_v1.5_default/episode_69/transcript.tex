	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Muvy has a direct effect on kwox and kwoz. Kwox has a direct effect on swoq. Swoq has a direct effect on kwoz. Muvy is unobserved. The overall probability of kwox is 28%. The probability of not kwox and kwoz is 65%. The probability of kwox and kwoz is 21%. Is the chance of kwoz smaller when observing kwox?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, the chance of kwoz is not smaller when observing kwox.\\ \tt \\ \tt To analyze this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability and the causal relationships between the variables. Let's denote the probability of kwoz given kwox as P(kwoz|kwox) and the probability of kwoz given not kwox as P(kwoz|not kwox).\\ \tt \\ \tt We are given the following information:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Muvy has a direct effect on kwox and kwoz.\\ \tt 2. Kwox has a direct effect on swoq.\\ \tt 3. Swoq has a direct effect on kwoz.\\ \tt 4. The overall probability of kwox is 28%.\\ \tt 5. The probability of not kwox and kwoz is 65%.\\ \tt 6. The probability of kwox and kwoz is 21%.\\ \tt \\ \tt We can use the law of total probability to express the overall probability of kwoz as a function of the conditional probabilities:\\ \tt \\ \tt P(kwoz) = P(kwoz|kwox)P(kwox) + P(kwoz|not kwox)P(not kwox)\\ \tt \\ \tt We are also given that P(kwox) = 0.28 and P(not kwox and kwoz) = 0.65. We can use this information to find P(kwoz|not kwox):\\ \tt \\ \tt P(kwoz|not k
