The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Unobserved confounders has a direct effect on education level and salary. Proximity to a college has a direct effect on education level. Education level has a direct effect on salary. Unobserved confounders is unobserved. For people living far from a college, the probability of high salary is 39%. For people living close to a college, the probability of high salary is 49%. For people living far from a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 57%. For people living close to a college, the probability of college degree or higher is 30%. Will college degree or higher increase the chance of high salary?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Let's denote the potential outcomes as follows:\n\n- Y: high salary (1) or low salary (0)\n- X: college degree or higher (1) or not (0)\n- C: living close to a college (1) or far from a college (0)\n- U: unobserved confounders\n\nWe are given the following conditional probabilities:\n\n- P(Y=1|C=0) = 0.39 (probability of high salary for people living far from a college)\n- P(Y=1|C=1) = 0.49 (probability of high salary for people living close to a college)\n- P(X=1|C=0) = 0.57 (probability of college degree or higher for people living far from a college)\n- P(X=1|C=1) = 0.30 (probability of college degree or higher for people living close to a college)\n\nWe want to estimate the causal effect of X on Y, which is denoted as P(Y=1|X=1, C=0) - P(Y=1|X=0, C=0). However, since U is an unobserved confounder, we cannot directly estimate this effect using the given probabilities.\n\nTo overcome this issue, we can use the concept of conditional probabilities and the law of total probability.",
