	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Hwax has a direct effect on kraz and pexu. Pexu has a direct effect on rukz. Kraz has a direct effect on rukz. The overall probability of pexu is 41%. For those who are not pexu, the probability of rukz is 66%. For those who are pexu, the probability of rukz is 22%. Is rukz more likely than not rukz overall?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No, rukz is not more likely than not rukz overall.\\ \tt \\ \tt To understand this, we need to apply the principles of causal inference, specifically the concept of confounding variables. In this scenario, pexu is a confounding variable because it affects both the outcome (rukz) and the exposure (kraz and pexu). \\ \tt \\ \tt We can use the counterfactual framework to analyze the situation. Let's define the following:\\ \tt \\ \tt - P(Rukz|Hwax) as the probability of rukz given the presence of hwax\\ \tt - P(Rukz|~Hwax) as the probability of rukz given the absence of hwax\\ \tt - P(Rukz|Pexu) as the probability of rukz given the presence of pexu\\ \tt - P(Rukz|~Pexu) as the probability of rukz given the absence of pexu\\ \tt \\ \tt We are given that P(Pexu) = 0.41, P(Rukz|~Pexu) = 0.66, and P(Rukz|Pexu) = 0.22.\\ \tt \\ \tt To determine the overall probability of rukz, we need to consider the joint effect of hwax and pexu on rukz. However, we are not given the direct effect of hwax on rukz, so we cannot directly calculate P(Rukz|Hwax).\\ \tt \\ \tt Instead, we can use the law of total probability to
