Education level has a direct effect on skill.\n2. Skill has a direct effect on black hair.\n3. Overall probability of college degree or higher is 6%.\n4. Probability of high school degree or lower and black hair is 25%.\n5. Probability of college degree or higher and black hair is 3%.\n\nWe can use the concept of conditional probability to analyze this situation. Let's define the following events:\n\n- A: College degree or higher\n- B: Black hair\n- S: Skill\n\nGiven the direct effect of skill on black hair, we can assume that the probability of black hair given skill is a constant, say P(B|S). \n\nWe can use the law of total probability to calculate the overall probability of black hair:\n\nP(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A')P(A')\n\nwhere P(B|A) is the probability of black hair given college degree or higher, P(B|A') is the probability of black hair given high school degree or lower, and P(A') is the probability of high school degree or lower.\n\nWe are given P(B|A) = 3% and P(B|A') = 25%. We can calculate P(A) = 6% and P(A') = 94% (since the overall probability of",
