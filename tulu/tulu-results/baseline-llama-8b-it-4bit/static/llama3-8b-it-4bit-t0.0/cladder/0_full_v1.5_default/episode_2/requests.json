Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 24%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 60%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 39%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of employee being fired is 74%. The overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 18%. Will manager signing the termination letter increase the chance of employee being fired?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Let's define the following variables:\n\n- Y: Employee being fired\n- X: Manager signing the termination letter\n- W: CEO's decision to fire the employee\n\nWe are given the following conditional probabilities:\n\n- P(Y|W=1, X=0) = 24% (CEO fires, manager doesn't sign)\n- P(Y|W=1, X=1) = 60% (CEO fires, manager signs)\n- P(Y|W=0, X=0) = 39% (CEO doesn't fire, manager doesn't sign)\n- P(Y|W=0, X=1) = 74% (CEO doesn't fire, manager signs)\n\nWe are also given the overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee:\n\n- P(W=1) = 18%\n\nWe want to estimate the effect of manager signing the termination letter on the probability of employee being fired. To do this, we can use the counterfactual framework and estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) of manager signing on employee being fired.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the probability of employee being fired when the manager signs, given that the CEO fires:\n\nP(Y|W=1, X=1) = 0.18 * 0.60 + 0.82 * 0.74 ≈",
