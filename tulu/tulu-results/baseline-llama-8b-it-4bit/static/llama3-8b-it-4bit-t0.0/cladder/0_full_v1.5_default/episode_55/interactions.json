The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on rainfall. Traffic has a direct effect on rainfall. The overall probability of waking up late is 9%. The probability of waking up on time and high rainfall is 53%. The probability of waking up late and high rainfall is 8%. Is the chance of high rainfall smaller when observing waking up late?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Let's denote the event of waking up on time as WOT, the event of waking up late as WOL, and the event of high rainfall as HR.\n\nGiven the probabilities:\n- P(WOT ∩ HR) = 53%\n- P(WOL ∩ HR) = 8%\n\nWe can calculate the probability of high rainfall given waking up late (P(HR|WOL)) using Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(HR|WOL) = P(WOL ∩ HR) / P(WOL)\n= 8% / (9% + P(WOL ∩ HR) - P(WOT ∩ HR))\n= 8% / (9% + 8% - 53%)\n= 8% / (-36%) \n\nHowever, the above calculation is incorrect because the denominator is negative. This is due to the fact that the given probabilities are not consistent with the problem's constraints. The probability of waking up late is 9%, and the probability of waking up on time and high rainfall is 53%. This implies that the probability of waking up on time and low rainfall is 0%, which is not possible. \n\nTo resolve this issue, we can assume that the given probabilities are for the entire population, and the probability of waking up on time and low rainfall is",
