Traffic has a direct effect on rainfall. The overall probability of waking up late is 9%. The probability of waking up on time and high rainfall is 53%. The probability of waking up late and high rainfall is 8%.

Let's denote the event of waking up on time as WOT, the event of waking up late as WOL, and the event of high rainfall as HR.\n\nGiven the probabilities:\n- P(WOT ∩ HR) = 53%\n- P(WOL ∩ HR) = 8%\n\nWe can calculate the probability of high rainfall given waking up late (P(HR|WOL)) using Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(HR|WOL) = P(WOL ∩ HR) / P(WOL)\n= 8% / (9% + P(WOL ∩ HR) - P(WOT ∩ HR))\n= 8% / (9% + 8% - 53%)\n= 8% / (-36%) \n\nHowever, the above calculation is incorrect because the denominator is negative. This is due to the fact that the given probabilities are not consistent with the problem's constraints. The probability of waking up late is 9%, and the probability of waking up on time and high rainfall is 53%. This implies that the probability of waking up on time and low rainfall is 0%, which is not possible. \n\nTo resolve this issue, we can assume that the given probabilities are for the entire population, and the probability of waking up on time and low rainfall is",
