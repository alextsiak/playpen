Wife has a direct effect on alarm clock. The overall probability of alarm set by husband is 8%. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 75%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 16%. Is ringing alarm more likely than silent alarm overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Let's define the following variables:\n\n- H: Husband sets the alarm (binary variable)\n- W: Wife's action (binary variable, but its value is not directly observable)\n- A: Alarm is set (binary variable)\n- R: Alarm rings (binary variable)\n\nGiven the information provided:\n\n1. P(A|H) = 8% (probability of alarm set by husband)\n2. P(R|H=0) = 75% (probability of ringing alarm when husband doesn't set it)\n3. P(R|H=1) = 16% (probability of ringing alarm when husband sets it)\n\nWe can calculate the overall probability of ringing alarm (P(R)) using the law of total probability:\n\nP(R) = P(R|H=1) \\* P(H=1) + P(R|H=0) \\* P(H=0)\n\nFirst, we need to find P(H=1) and P(H=0). Since P(A|H) = 8%, we can infer that P(H=1) = P(A) = 8% (assuming the husband's action is the primary cause of the alarm being set). Then, P(H=0) = 1 - P(H=1) = 92%.\n\nNow, we can substitute the values:\n\nP(R) = 16",
