The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on foot size. Going to the beach has a direct effect on foot size. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 10%. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of large feet is 13%. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of large feet is 70%. Is large feet more likely than small feet overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Tanning salon treatment has a direct effect on foot size.\n2. Going to the beach has a direct effect on foot size.\n3. The overall probability of tanning salon treatment is 10%.\n4. For people not using tanning salon treatments, the probability of large feet is 13%.\n5. For people who went to tanning salons, the probability of large feet is 70%.\n\nWe can use the potential outcomes framework to analyze this problem. Let's define two potential outcomes: large feet (L) and small feet (S). We can also define two treatment groups: tanning salon treatment (T) and not using tanning salon treatment (NT).\n\nGiven the information, we can construct a 2x2 table with the following probabilities:\n\n|  | T | NT |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| L | 0.7 | 0.13 |\n| S | 0.3 | 0.87 |\n\nThe overall probability of large feet (P(L)) can be calculated as follows:\n\nP(L) = P(L|T) \\* P(T) + P(L|NT) \\* P(NT)\n= 0.7 \\* 0.1 + 0.13 \\* 0.9\n= 0.07 + 0.117\n= 0",
