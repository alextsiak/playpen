	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Xevo has a direct effect on tijv and gyzp. Tijw has a direct effect on tijv and gyzp. Tijv has a direct effect on gyzp. Tijw is unobserved. We know that xevo or tijw causes tijv. xevo or tijw or tijv causes gyzp. We observed an individual is tijw. Would an individual is not gyzp if not xevo instead of xevo?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No\\ \tt \\ \tt In this hypothetical world, we have the following causal relationships:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Xevo → tijv\\ \tt 2. Tijw → tijv\\ \tt 3. Tijv → gyzp\\ \tt \\ \tt Given that we know xevo or tijw causes tijv, and xevo or tijw or tijv causes gyzp, we can infer the following:\\ \tt \\ \tt - If xevo causes tijv, then xevo → gyzp (through tijv)\\ \tt - If tijw causes tijv, then tijw → gyzp (through tijv)\\ \tt \\ \tt Since tijw is unobserved, we cannot directly observe its effect on gyzp. However, we can use the given information to make an inference.\\ \tt \\ \tt We are given that an individual is tijw. This implies that tijw causes tijv (since tijw → tijv). Now, if tijw causes tijv, then tijw → gyzp (through tijv). This means that even if xevo is not present, the individual is still gyzp (since tijw causes tijv, which in turn causes gyzp).\\ \tt \\ \tt Therefore, the presence or absence of xevo does not affect the individual's gyzp status in this scenario.
