The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Rixq has a direct effect on zuph and xevu. Swoy has a direct effect on zuph and xevu. Zuph has a direct effect on xevu. Swoy is unobserved. The overall probability of rixq is 70%. The probability of not rixq and xevu is 6%. The probability of rixq and xevu is 10%. Is the chance of xevu larger when observing rixq?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Let's denote the probability of xevu given rixq as P(xevu | rixq) and the probability of xevu given not rixq as P(xevu | not rixq).\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n\n1. P(rixq) = 0.7\n2. P(not rixq and xevu) = 0.06\n3. P(rixq and xevu) = 0.1\n\nWe can use the law of total probability to find P(xevu):\n\nP(xevu) = P(xevu | rixq) * P(rixq) + P(xevu | not rixq) * P(not rixq)\n\nWe also know that P(not rixq) = 1 - P(rixq) = 0.3.\n\nWe can rewrite the equation as:\n\nP(xevu) = P(xevu | rixq) * 0.7 + P(xevu | not rixq) * 0.3\n\nWe are also given that P(not rixq and xevu) = 0.06 and P(rixq and xevu) = 0.1. We can use these probabilities to find P(x",
