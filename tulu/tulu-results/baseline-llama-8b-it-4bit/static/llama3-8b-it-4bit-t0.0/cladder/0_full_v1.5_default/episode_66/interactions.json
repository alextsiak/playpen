The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Rixq has a direct effect on zuph and xevu. Swoy has a direct effect on zuph and xevu. Zuph has a direct effect on xevu. Swoy is unobserved. The overall probability of rixq is 70%. The probability of not rixq and xevu is 6%. The probability of rixq and xevu is 10%. Is the chance of xevu larger when observing rixq?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

Let's denote the probability of xevu given rixq as P(xevu | rixq) and the probability of xevu given not rixq as P(xevu | not rixq).\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n\n1. P(rixq) = 0.7\n2. P(not rixq and xevu) = 0.06\n3. P(rixq and xevu) = 0.1\n\nWe can use the law of total probability to find P(xevu):\n\nP(xevu) = P(xevu | rixq) * P(rixq) + P(xevu | not rixq) * P(not rixq)\n\nWe also know that P(not rixq) = 1 - P(rixq) = 0.3.\n\nWe can rewrite the equation as:\n\nP(xevu) = P(xevu | rixq) * 0.7 + P(xevu | not rixq) * 0.3\n\nWe are also given that P(not rixq and xevu) = 0.06 and P(rixq and xevu) = 0.1.
