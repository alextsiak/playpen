	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Zory has a direct effect on zuph and glimx. Zuph has a direct effect on jyka. Jyka has a direct effect on glimx. Zory is unobserved. We know that zory causes zuph. zuph causes not jyka. zory or jyka causes glimx. We observed an individual is zory. Would an individual is not glimx if not zuph instead of zuph?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No\\ \tt \\ \tt In this hypothetical world, we have the following causal relationships:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Zory causes Zuph\\ \tt 2. Zuph causes not Jyka (i.e., Jyka is the effect of Zuph, but we are interested in the effect of not Zuph)\\ \tt 3. Zory or Jyka causes Glimx\\ \tt \\ \tt Since Zory is observed, we can infer that Zuph is also observed (due to the direct effect of Zory on Zuph). Now, we are interested in the effect of not Zuph on Glimx.\\ \tt \\ \tt To answer this question, we need to consider the potential outcomes of not Zuph. If Zuph is not observed, then Jyka is not observed (due to the direct effect of Zuph on Jyka). However, since Zory is observed, Jyka is still observed (due to the direct effect of Zory or Jyka on Glimx). \\ \tt \\ \tt Now, we need to consider the effect of not Zuph on Glimx. Since Zuph causes not Jyka, not Zuph would cause Jyka. However, since Zory or Jyka causes Glimx, not Zuph would still cause Glimx (through Jyka). \\ \tt \\ \tt Therefore, an individual is still Glimx if not Zuph instead of Zuph.
