The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on foot size. Director has a direct effect on foot size. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 62%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 15%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 83%. For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 35%. The overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 94%. Will manager signing the termination letter increase the chance of large feet?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

CEO has a direct effect on director and manager.\n2. Manager has a direct effect on foot size.\n3. Director has a direct effect on foot size.\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n\n- For CEOs who fire employees and managers who don't sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 83%.\n- For CEOs who fire employees and managers who sign termination letters, the probability of large feet is 35%.\n\nWe are also given the overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee, which is 94%. This implies that the probability of a CEO not firing an employee is 6%.\n\nWe can calculate the probability of large feet for CEOs who don't fire employees by using the law of total probability:\n\nP(large feet | don't fire) = P(large feet | fire and sign) * P(fire and sign) + P(large feet | fire and don't sign) * P(fire and don't sign)\n= 35% * (6% / 94%) + 83% * (6% / 94%)\n= 35% * 0.0638 + 83% * 0.0638\n= 2.23% + 5.29%\n= 7.52%\n\nNow, we can compare the probabilities of large feet for two",
