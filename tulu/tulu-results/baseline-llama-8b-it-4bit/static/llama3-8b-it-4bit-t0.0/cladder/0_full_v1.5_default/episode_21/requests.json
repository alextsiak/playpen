The probability of waking up late is 5%.\n2. When Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 52%.\n3. When Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 87%.\n\nWe can calculate the overall probability of arriving to school on time by considering two scenarios: waking up on time and waking up late.\n\n- Probability of waking up on time: 95% (100% - 5%)\n- Probability of arriving to school on time given waking up on time: 52%\n- Probability of arriving to school on time given waking up late: 87%\n\nUsing the law of total probability, we can calculate the overall probability of arriving to school on time as follows:\n\nP(arriving on time) = P(waking up on time) * P(arriving on time | waking up on time) + P(waking up late) * P(arriving on time | waking up late)\n= 0.95 * 0.52 + 0.05 * 0.87\n= 0.494 + 0.0435\n= 0.5375\n\nNow, let's calculate the overall probability of arriving to school late:\n\nP(arriving late) = 1 - P(arriving on time)\n= 1 - ",
