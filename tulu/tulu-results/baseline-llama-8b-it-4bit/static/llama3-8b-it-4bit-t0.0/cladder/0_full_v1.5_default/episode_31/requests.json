The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gene has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Pollution has a direct effect on smoking and lung cancer. Smoking has a direct effect on lung cancer. Pollution is unobserved. For people with nonsmoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 56%. For people with nonsmoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 42%. For people with smoking genes and nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 60%. For people with smoking genes and smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 40%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 76%. For people with nonsmoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 48%. For people with smoking genes and with low pollution, the probability of smoking is 46%. For people with smoking genes and with high pollution, the probability of smoking is 21%. The overall probability of high pollution is 41%. Does gene positively affect lung cancer through smoking?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

We can define the following potential outcomes:\n\n- L: Lung cancer\n- S: Smoking\n- G: Gene (smoking or nonsmoking)\n- P: Pollution (high or low)\n\nWe are given the following conditional probabilities:\n\n- P(L|G=non-smoking, S=nonsmoking) = 0.56\n- P(L|G=non-smoking, S=smoking) = 0.42\n- P(L|G=smoking, S=nonsmoking) = 0.60\n- P(L|G=smoking, S=smoking) = 0.40\n- P(S|G=non-smoking, P=low) = 0.76\n- P(S|G=non-smoking, P=high) = 0.48\n- P(S|G=smoking, P=low) = 0.46\n- P(S|G=smoking, P=high) = 0.21\n- P(P=high) = 0.41\n\nWe can use the counterfactuals to assess the effect of the gene on lung cancer through smoking. Let's define the following counterfactuals:\n\n- L(G, S) = the potential outcome of lung cancer",
