The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Jyka has a direct effect on hwax. Hwax has a direct effect on lirg. The overall probability of jyka is 14%. The probability of not jyka and lirg is 72%. The probability of jyka and lirg is 12%. Is the chance of lirg smaller when observing jyka?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

We also know that P(Lirg|Jyka ∧ ¬Jyka) = P(Lirg) because Lirg is a common effect of both Jyka and hwax. \n\nHowever, we cannot directly calculate P(Lirg|Jyka) and P(Lirg|¬Jyka) from the given information. We can use the given probabilities to find the conditional probability of Lirg given Jyka and ¬Jyka.\n\nP(Jyka",
