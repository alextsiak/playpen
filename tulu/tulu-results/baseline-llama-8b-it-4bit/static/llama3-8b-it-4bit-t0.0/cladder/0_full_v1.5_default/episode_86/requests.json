Hwax has a direct effect on lirg. The overall probability of jyka is 14%. The probability of not jyka and lirg is 72%. The probability of jyka and lirg is 12%. Is the chance of lirg smaller when observing jyka?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Given the information:\n\n1. Jyka has a direct effect on hwax.\n2. Hwax has a direct effect on lirg.\n3. P(Jyka) = 14%\n4. P(¬Jyka ∧ Lirg) = 72%\n5. P(Jyka ∧ Lirg) = 12%\n\nWe can use the law of total probability to find the unconditional probability of Lirg:\n\nP(Lirg) = P(Lirg|Jyka)P(Jyka) + P(Lirg|¬Jyka)P(¬Jyka)\n\nWe know that P(Jyka) = 14% and P(¬Jyka) = 1 - P(Jyka) = 86%. We also know that P(Lirg|Jyka ∧ ¬Jyka) = P(Lirg) because Lirg is a common effect of both Jyka and hwax. \n\nHowever, we cannot directly calculate P(Lirg|Jyka) and P(Lirg|¬Jyka) from the given information. We can use the given probabilities to find the conditional probability of Lirg given Jyka and ¬Jyka.\n\nP(Jyka",
