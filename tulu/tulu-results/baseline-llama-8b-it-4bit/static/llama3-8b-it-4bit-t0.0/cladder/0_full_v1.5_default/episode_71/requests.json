The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gwet has a direct effect on yomx and xevu. Yomx has a direct effect on xevu. For those who are not gwet and are not yomx, the probability of xevu is 82%. For those who are not gwet and are yomx, the probability of xevu is 63%. For those who are gwet and are not yomx, the probability of xevu is 36%. For those who are gwet and are yomx, the probability of xevu is 18%. The overall probability of gwet is 41%. Will yomx increase the chance of xevu?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Let's define the following probabilities:\n\n- P(xevu|not gwet, not yomx) = 0.82\n- P(xevu|not gwet, yomx) = 0.63\n- P(xevu|gwet, not yomx) = 0.36\n- P(xevu|gwet, yomx) = 0.18\n- P(gwet) = 0.41\n\nWe can calculate the overall probability of xevu as follows:\n\nP(xevu) = P(gwet) * P(xevu|gwet) + P(not gwet) * P(xevu|not gwet)\n= 0.41 * (0.41 * P(xevu|gwet, yomx) + 0.59 * P(xevu|gwet, not yomx)) + 0.59 * (0.41 * P(xevu|not gwet, yomx) + 0.59 * P(xevu|not gwet, not yomx))\n= 0.41 * (0.41 * 0.18 + 0.59 * 0.36) + 0.",
