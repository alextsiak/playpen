	 You are an expert in causal inference. The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\\ \tt Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Qwiu has a direct effect on jyka and kwox. Jyka has a direct effect on yupt. Yupt has a direct effect on kwox. Qwiu is unobserved. We know that qwiu causes jyka. jyka causes not yupt. qwiu or yupt causes kwox. We observed an individual is qwiu. Would an individual is kwox if jyka instead of not jyka?\\ \tt Start your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.

	 No\\ \tt \\ \tt The given conditions imply a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with the following structure:\\ \tt \\ \tt Qwiu → Jyka → Yupt → Kwox\\ \tt \\ \tt We know that Qwiu causes Jyka, and Jyka does not cause Yupt. However, Yupt causes Kwox. \\ \tt \\ \tt Given that we observed an individual is Qwiu, we want to know whether an individual is Kwox if Jyka instead of not Jyka. \\ \tt \\ \tt To answer this question, we need to consider the causal relationships between the variables. Since Qwiu causes Jyka, and Jyka does not cause Yupt, the presence of Jyka does not affect the causal relationship between Yupt and Kwox. \\ \tt \\ \tt In other words, the causal effect of Yupt on Kwox is not mediated by Jyka. Therefore, the presence of Jyka does not change the probability of an individual being Kwox, given that we observed an individual is Qwiu. \\ \tt \\ \tt The causal effect of Qwiu on Kwox is direct, and the presence of Jyka does not alter this direct effect. Hence, the answer is No, an individual is not Kwox if Jyka instead of not Jyka.
