The probability of smoking is 12%.\n2. For nonsmokers, the probability of lung cancer is 58%.\n3. For smokers, the probability of lung cancer is 61%.\n\nWe are not given the probability of lung cancer among nonsmokers or smokers directly, but we can infer it from the given information. Let's denote the probability of lung cancer among nonsmokers as P(LC|NS) and the probability of lung cancer among smokers as P(LC|S).\n\nWe know that the overall probability of lung cancer is a weighted average of the probabilities of lung cancer among smokers and nonsmokers, where the weights are the probabilities of smoking and nonsmoking. However, we don't know the exact probabilities of lung cancer among smokers and nonsmokers.\n\nTo assess whether lung cancer is more likely than its absence overall, we need to compare the overall probability of lung cancer to the overall probability of its absence. However, we are not given the overall probability of lung cancer or its absence directly.\n\nTo make progress, let's consider the following: if we knew the overall probability of lung cancer, we could compare it to the overall probability of its absence. However, we are not given this information. \n\nHowever, we can use the given information to derive the overall probability of lung cancer. Let's denote the overall probability of lung cancer",
