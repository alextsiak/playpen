The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Alice waking up has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. Traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school. For days when Alice wakes up on time, the probability of arriving to school on time is 46%. For days when Alice wakes up late, the probability of arriving to school on time is 78%. Will waking up late increase the chance of arriving to school on time?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

However, we also have a conditional probability of arriving to school on time given Alice's wake-up time. \n\nTo assess the effect of waking up late on the probability of arriving to school on time, we need to consider the potential confounding effect of traffic. Since traffic has a direct effect on Alice arriving to school, it may also be correlated with Alice's wake-up time. \n\nIn this case, the observed probabilities (46% for waking up on time and 78% for waking up late) may not accurately reflect the true causal effect of waking up late on arriving to school on time. \n\nTo establish causality, we would need to control for the potential confounding effect of traffic. However, the information provided does not allow us to do so. \n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that waking up late will increase the chance of arriving to school on time.",
