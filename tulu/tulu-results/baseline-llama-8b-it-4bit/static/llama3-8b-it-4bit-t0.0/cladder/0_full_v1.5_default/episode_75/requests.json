Let's denote the probability of kwox given jyka as P(kwox|jyka) and the probability of kwox given not jyka as P(kwox|not jyka).\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n\n1. P(jyka) = 0.25\n2. P(not jyka and kwox) = 0.71\n3. P(jyka and kwox) = 0.24\n\nWe can use the law of total probability to find P(kwox):\n\nP(kwox) = P(kwox|jyka)P(jyka) + P(kwox|not jyka)P(not jyka)\n\nWe know that P(kwox and not jyka) = 0.71, and P(jyka and kwox) = 0.24. We can use these values to find P(kwox|not jyka):\n\nP(kwox|not jyka) = P(kwox and not jyka) / P(not jyka)\n= 0.71 / (1 - P(jyka))\n= 0.71 / (1 - 0.25)\n=",
