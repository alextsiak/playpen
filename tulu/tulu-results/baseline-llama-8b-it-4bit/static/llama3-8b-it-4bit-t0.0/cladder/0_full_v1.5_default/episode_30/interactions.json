The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Demand has a direct effect on supply and price. Yield per acre has a direct effect on supply. Supply has a direct effect on price. Demand is unobserved. The overall probability of increased supply is 78%. For situations with reduced supply, the probability of increased price is 44%. For situations with increased supply, the probability of increased price is 81%. Is increased price less likely than reduced price overall?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.",

We are given the following information:\n\n1. The probability of increased supply is 78%.\n2. The probability of increased price given reduced supply is 44%.\n3. The probability of increased price given increased supply is 81%.\n\nWe want to compare the overall probability of increased price versus reduced price. To do this, we can use the law of total probability, which states that the overall probability of an event is the sum of the probabilities of the event given each possible cause, weighted by the probability of each cause.\n\nLet's define the following events:\n\n- I: Increased price\n- R: Reduced price\n- S: Increased supply\n- L: Reduced supply\n\nWe are given the following conditional probabilities:\n\nP(S) = 0.78 (probability of increased supply)\nP(L) = 1 - P(S) = 0.22 (probability of reduced supply)\nP(I|L) = 0.44 (probability of increased price given reduced supply)\nP(I|S) = 0.81 (probability of increased price given increased supply)\n\nWe want to compare P(I) and P(R). To do this, we can use the law of total probability:\n\nP(I) = P(I|S)P(S) + P(I|L)P(L)\n= 0.81(0",
