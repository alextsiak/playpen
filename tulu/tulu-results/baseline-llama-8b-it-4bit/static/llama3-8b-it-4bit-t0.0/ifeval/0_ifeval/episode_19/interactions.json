Here are a few options to consider:\n\n**Option 1: Positive Reinforcement Training**\nThis method focuses on rewarding good behavior with treats, praise, and affection. It's a gentle and effective approach that helps build trust between you and your puppy.\n\n**Option 2: Clicker Training**\nClicker training uses a small device that makes a distinct sound when pressed, marking the exact moment your puppy performs the desired behavior. This method is great for teaching complex behaviors and can be very efficient.\n\n**Option 3: Puppy Socialization and Training Classes**\nEnrolling in a puppy socialization and training class can provide a structured environment for your puppy to learn basic obedience commands, interact with other dogs, and receive guidance from an experienced trainer.\n\n**Option 4: Online Puppy Training Resources**\nThere are many online resources, such as videos, blogs, and forums, that offer puppy training advice and guidance. These resources can be a great supplement to in-person training or a starting point for new puppy owners.\n\nWhich one you choose?",
