An excluded scientist who is asked to stay home could be called a \"home-schooled\" scientist, but a more fitting answer would be a \"stay-at-home\" scientist. However, the most fitting answer would be a \"home-bound\" scientist.\n\nP.P.S: But if you're looking for a more humorous answer, you could call them a \"lab-less\" scientist or a \"research-less\" scientist, but I think the best answer would be a \"home-sick\" scientist, as in, they're home-sick because they're excluded from the lab.<|eot_id|>",
