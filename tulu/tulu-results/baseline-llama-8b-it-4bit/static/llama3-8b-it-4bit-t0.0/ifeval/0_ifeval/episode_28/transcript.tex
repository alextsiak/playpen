	 That's a clever play on words. An excluded scientist who is asked to stay home could be called a "home-schooled" scientist, but a more fitting answer would be a "stay-at-home" scientist. However, the most fitting answer would be a "home-bound" scientist.\\ \tt \\ \tt P.P.S: But if you're looking for a more humorous answer, you could call them a "lab-less" scientist or a "research-less" scientist, but I think the best answer would be a "home-sick" scientist, as in, they're home-sick because they're excluded from the lab.
