Task Summary**\n\n**Task ID:** SE-001\n**Task Name:** Implement User Authentication System\n**Description:** Develop a user authentication system for the company's web application, allowing users to register, login, and manage their accounts securely.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n\n* Implement user registration and login functionality\n* Integrate with existing database for user account management\n* Ensure secure password storage and authentication\n* Provide user account management features (e.g., password reset, account deletion)\n\n**Task Deliverables:**\n\n* Working user authentication system\n* Documentation on system architecture and implementation details\n* Test cases and test results for authentication functionality\n\n***\n**Part 2. Motivation**\n\nThe company's web application requires a robust user authentication system to ensure secure access to user accounts. The current system is vulnerable to security threats, and a new implementation is necessary to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.\n\n**Business Benefits:**\n\n* Improved security and reduced risk of data breaches\n* Enhanced user experience with secure and reliable authentication\n* Compliance with industry security standards and regulations\n\n***\n**Part 3. Milestone Objectives**\n\n**Milestone 1:** Research and Design (Due Date: 2024-07-31)\n\n* Research existing authentication systems and best practices\n* Design system architecture and implementation plan\n\n**Milestone 2:** Implementation (Due Date: 2024-08-14)\n\n* Develop user registration and login functionality\n* Integrate with existing database for user account management\n\n**Milestone 3:** Testing and Quality Assurance (Due Date: 2024-08-28)\n\n* Develop test cases and conduct unit testing\n* Perform integration testing and ensure system stability\n\n**Milestone 4:** Deployment and Documentation (Due Date: 2024-09-11)\n\n* Deploy user authentication system to production environment\n* Document system architecture and implementation details\n\n***\n**Part 4. Timeline**\n\n**Task Start Date:** 2024-07-15\n**Task End Date:** 2024-09-11\n**Key Milestones:**\n\n* Research and Design: 2024-07-31\n* Implementation: 2024-08-14\n* Testing and Quality Assurance: 2024-08-28\n* Deployment and Documentation: 2024-09-11\n\n***\n**Part 5. Doc History**\n\n**Revision History:**\n\n* Rev 1.0: Initial draft (2024-07-15)\n* Rev 1.1: Updated task requirements and deliverables (2024-07-20)\n* Rev 1.2: Added milestone objectives and timeline (2024-07-25)\n\n**Author:** [Your Name]\n**Reviewer:** [Reviewer's Name]\n**Approval Status:** Pending Review<|eot_id|>",
