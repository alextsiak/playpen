I felt my anxiety spiking as I tried to prioritize tasks and adjust our project plan. To manage my stress, I took a few minutes to breathe and focus on the present moment, reminding myself that I've handled similar situations before. I also reached out to a colleague for support and together we came up with a revised plan that met our needs. By taking a step back and seeking help, I was able to regain control and tackle the day with a clearer head.\"\n\nThis example reflects a common stress scenario, acknowledges the emotions involved, and highlights effective stress management strategies such as taking a break, seeking support, and reframing the situation.",
