	 To come up with a journal entry about stress management, I'll consider a common scenario where someone might experience stress and then reflect on how they managed it. Here's an example:\\ \tt \\ \tt **Journal Entry:**\\ \tt \\ \tt "Today was a chaotic day at work, with multiple deadlines looming and a team member calling in sick. I felt my anxiety spiking as I tried to prioritize tasks and adjust our project plan. To manage my stress, I took a few minutes to breathe and focus on the present moment, reminding myself that I've handled similar situations before. I also reached out to a colleague for support and together we came up with a revised plan that met our needs. By taking a step back and seeking help, I was able to regain control and tackle the day with a clearer head."\\ \tt \\ \tt This example reflects a common stress scenario, acknowledges the emotions involved, and highlights effective stress management strategies such as taking a break, seeking support, and reframing the situation.
