To wake them up, a surprise awaits - a giant inflatable unicorn perched on the quad, blasting disco music. The students are greeted by a group of energetic campus ambassadors, dressed in matching neon wigs and sunglasses, who hand out welcome packets and a map of the campus. The first activity of the day is a scavenger hunt, where teams have to find and take a photo with the most creative use of a campus landmark. The winning team gets a prize - a year's supply of pizza.\n\n***\n\n\n**Day 2: Campus Shenanigans**\n\nThe second day starts with a bang - literally. A group of students dressed as superheroes, complete with capes and masks, lead a campus-wide game of capture the flag. The twist? The flags are actually giant inflatable chickens, and the game is played with Nerf guns. After a morning of chaos, the students gather for a picnic lunch, where they're treated to a surprise performance by a local a cappella group. The afternoon is spent at the campus pool, where a giant inflatable obstacle course awaits. Who can make it through without getting splashed?\n\n***\n\n\n**Day 3: Campus Games and Giggles**\n\nThe final day of the trip is all about friendly competition. The students gather for a series of campus games, including a giant Jenga tournament, a water balloon toss, and a round of \"Would You Rather.\" The grand prize? A year's supply of ice cream. The day ends with a bonfire, where students can roast marshmallows and share stories of their favorite campus adventures. As the night winds down, the students are treated to a surprise fireworks display, complete with a giant \"UCI\" written in sparklers.\n\n***<|eot_id|>",
