	 I'm writing this from my room I'm trying to stay calm but I'm really scared. I've been noticing this guy following me everywhere I go. He's always lurking in the background but I can feel his eyes on me. I've tried to ignore him but it's getting to the point where I'm starting to feel like I'm in danger. I've seen him at school and at the mall and even just walking down the street. I've tried to talk to my friends about it but they just tell me to be careful. I don't know what to do I feel so alone. I just wish I could feel safe again.
