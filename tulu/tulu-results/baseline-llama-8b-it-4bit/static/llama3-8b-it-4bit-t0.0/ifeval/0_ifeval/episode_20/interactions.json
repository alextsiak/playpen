This will prevent water from flowing into the toilet bowl.\n\n***\nStep 2: Disconnect the water supply line from the toilet by loosening the nut that holds the supply line in place. You may need to use a wrench or pliers to loosen the nut.\n\n***\nStep 3: Flush the toilet to drain the tank and bowl. This will make it easier to remove the old toilet.\n\n***\nStep 4: Remove the old toilet by breaking the wax ring that holds it in place. You can use a putty knife or a scraper to break the wax ring. Be careful not to damage the surrounding floor.\n\n***\nStep 5: Remove any remaining old toilet parts, such as the old wax ring and any old caulk or adhesive. This will ensure a clean surface for the new toilet.\n\n***\nLet me know how it works. I can give you next steps when you finish all steps above.",
