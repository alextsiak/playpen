Each member has at least one pet. If there are 32 pets in total, what is the maximum number of members that can possibly have 3 pets? Solve this step by step, and wrap your entire response (reasoning process and the final answer) with double quotation marks.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\"Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nStep 1: We know that the total number of members is 20 and the total number of pets is 32.\n\nStep 2: We want to find the maximum number of members that can possibly have 3 pets. Let's assume that 'x' members have 3 pets. Then, the remaining members will have either 1 or 2 pets.\n\nStep 3: The total number of pets can be represented as the sum of the pets of the members who have 3 pets, the pets of the members who have 2 pets, and the pets of the members who have 1 pet.\n\nStep 4: Since each member has at least one pet, the minimum number of pets for the members who have 1 pet is 1, and the minimum number of pets for the members who have 2 pets is 2.\n\nStep 5: Let's represent the number of members who have 1 pet as 'y'. Then, the number of members who have 2 pets is (20 - x - y).\n\nStep 6: The total number of pets can be represented as:\n3x + 2(20 - x - y) + y = 32\n\nStep 7: Simplifying the equation, we get:\n3x + 40 - 2x - 2y + y = 32\nx + 40 - y = 32\nx - y = -8\n\nStep 8: We want to find the maximum value of 'x'. To do this, we need to minimize the value of 'y'. Since 'y' represents the number of members who have 1 pet, the minimum value of 'y' is 0.\n\nStep 9: If 'y' is 0, then 'x' will be equal to -8. However, since 'x' represents the number of members who have 3 pets, it cannot be negative.\n\nStep 10: To find the maximum value of 'x', we need to find the maximum value of 'y' such that 'x' is still non-negative.\n\nStep 11: Let's try to find the maximum value of 'y'. Since 'y' represents the number of members who have 1 pet, the maximum value of 'y' is 20.\n\nStep 12: If 'y' is 20, then 'x' will be equal to -8. However, since 'x' represents the number of members who have 3 pets, it cannot be negative.\n\nStep 13: Let's try to find the next possible value of 'y'. Since 'y' represents the number of members who have 1 pet, the next possible value of 'y' is 19.\n\nStep 14: If 'y' is 19, then 'x' will be equal to -7. However, since 'x' represents the number of members who have 3 pets, it cannot be negative.\n\nStep 15: Let's try to find the next possible value of 'y'. Since 'y' represents the number of members who have 1 pet, the next possible value of 'y' is 18.\n\nStep 16: If 'y' is 18, then 'x' will be equal to -10. However, since 'x' represents the number of members who have 3 pets, it cannot be negative.\n\nStep 17: Let's try to find the next possible value of 'y'. Since 'y' represents the number of members who have 1 pet, the next possible value of 'y' is 17.\n\nStep 18: If 'y' is 17, then 'x' will be equal to -11. However, since 'x' represents the number of members who have 3 pets, it cannot be negative.\n\nStep 19: Let's try to find the next possible value of 'y'. Since 'y' represents the number of members who have 1 pet, the next possible value of 'y' is 16.\n\nStep 20: If 'y' is 16, then 'x' will be equal to -12. However, since 'x' represents the number of members who have 3 pets, it cannot be negative.\n\nStep 21: Let's try to find the next possible value of 'y'. Since 'y' represents the number of members who have 1 pet, the next possible value of 'y' is 15.\n\nStep 22: If 'y' is 15, then 'x' will be equal to -13. However, since 'x' represents the number of members who have 3 pets, it cannot be negative.\n\nStep 23: Let's try to find the next possible value of 'y'. Since 'y' represents the number of members who have 1 pet, the next possible value of 'y' is 14.\n\nStep 24: If 'y' is 14, then 'x' will be equal to -14. However, since 'x' represents the number of members who have 3 pets, it cannot be negative.\n\nStep 25: Let's try to find the next possible value of 'y'. Since 'y' represents the number of members who have 1 pet, the next possible value of 'y' is 13.\n\nStep 26: If 'y' is 13, then 'x' will be equal to -15. However, since 'x' represents the number of members who have 3 pets, it cannot be negative.\n\nStep 27: Let's try to find the next possible value of 'y'. Since 'y' represents the number of members who have 1 pet, the next possible value of 'y' is 12.\n\nStep 28: If 'y' is 12, then 'x' will be equal to -16. However, since 'x' represents the number of members who have 3 pets, it cannot be negative.\n\nStep 29: Let's try to find the next possible value of 'y'. Since 'y' represents the number of members who have 1 pet, the next possible value of 'y' is 11.\n\nStep",
