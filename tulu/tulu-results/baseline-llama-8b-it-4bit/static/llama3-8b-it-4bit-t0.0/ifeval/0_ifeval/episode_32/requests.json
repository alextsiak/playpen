A more common way to phrase it would be:\n\n\"Werner war ein guter Freund von mir, aber nicht sehr intelligent.\"\n\nOr, in a more informal setting:\n\n\"Werner war ein guter Freund von mir, aber nicht der cleverste.\"\n\nThe original sentence in English uses the phrase \"not very smart\" to convey that Werner is not intelligent or knowledgeable. In German, the word \"begabt\" (gifted) is often used to describe someone's intellectual abilities, but it can also imply a natural talent or aptitude. If you want to convey that someone is not intelligent or knowledgeable, you might use the word \"intelligent\" or \"klug\" (clever) in a more negative sense.\n\nIt's worth noting that the German language often uses more nuanced and subtle expressions to convey complex ideas, and the translation of the original sentence might not fully capture the intended meaning or tone.<|eot_id|>",
