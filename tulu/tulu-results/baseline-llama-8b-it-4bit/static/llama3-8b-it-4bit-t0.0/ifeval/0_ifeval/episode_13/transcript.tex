I think you're an amazing person, and I'd love the chance to spend more time with you. If you're not interested, I completely understand, and I promise to respect your decision. But if you are, I'd be thrilled to take things to the next level and see where our connection goes.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt ____________________________________________________\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt If you're free and interested, let me know, and we can start making plans.
