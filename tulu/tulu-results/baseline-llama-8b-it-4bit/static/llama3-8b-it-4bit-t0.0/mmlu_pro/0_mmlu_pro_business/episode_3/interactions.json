          "content": "To solve the last question, we need to calculate the theoretical forward price of gold for delivery in 9 months. \n\nFirst, we need to calculate the storage cost for 9 months. Since the storage cost is $2 per ounce per year, payable quarterly in advance, the quarterly storage cost is $2/4 = $0.5 per ounce. For 9 months, there are 3 quarters, so the total storage cost is $0.5 * 3 = $1.5 per ounce.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the interest earned on the storage cost. The interest rate is 9% compounded quarterly, so the interest rate per quarter is 9%/4 = 2.25%. The interest earned on the storage cost is $1.5 * 2.25% = $0.03375 per ounce.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the present value of the storage cost and the interest earned. The present value of the storage cost is $1.5 / (1 + 0.0225)^3 = $1.5 / 1.06875 = $1.4 per ounce. The present value of the interest earned is $0.03375 / (1 + 0.0225)^3 = $0.03375 / 1.06875 = $0.0316 per ounce.\n\nThe current price of gold is $412 per ounce.
