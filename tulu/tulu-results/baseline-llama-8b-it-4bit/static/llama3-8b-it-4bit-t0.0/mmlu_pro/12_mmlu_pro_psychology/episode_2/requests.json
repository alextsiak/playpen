Arousal only affects motivation in physical tasks.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe relationship between arousal and motivation is complex, but generally, arousal can influence motivation. Arousal is the physiological and psychological state of being alert and ready to respond to a stimulus. Motivation is the driving force behind behavior, which can be influenced by arousal.\n\nArousal can either increase or decrease motivation depending on the context and individual. For example, a moderate level of arousal can increase motivation by providing the energy and focus needed to tackle a task. However, extremely high or low levels of arousal can decrease motivation by causing anxiety or boredom.\n\nThe correct answer is not explicitly listed, but based on the options provided, the closest answer would be:\n\nB. Arousal level is a central aspect of motivation.\n\nThis answer suggests that arousal is an important factor in motivation, which is generally true. However, it's essential to note that the relationship between arousal and motivation is more complex and nuanced than this answer implies.<|eot_id|>",
