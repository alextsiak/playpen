The following question is not a typical commonsense query, but rather a meticulously designed question created by a professor specializing in causal inference, intended to assess the students' mastery of the course content.\nImagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Parents' intelligence has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors has a direct effect on parents' social status and child's intelligence. Parents' social status has a direct effect on child's intelligence. Other unobserved factors is unobserved. The overall probability of intelligent parents is 3%. The probability of unintelligent parents and intelligent child is 60%. The probability of intelligent parents and intelligent child is 2%. Is the chance of intelligent child larger when observing intelligent parents?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since parents' social status is also directly related to their intelligence, this additional link further dilutes the direct effect of parents' intelligence on child's intelligence. The overall probability of intelligent child is not directly dependent on the parents' intelligence, but rather on the joint probability of parents' social status and child's intelligence, which is not directly related to parents' intelligence.<|eot_id|>",
