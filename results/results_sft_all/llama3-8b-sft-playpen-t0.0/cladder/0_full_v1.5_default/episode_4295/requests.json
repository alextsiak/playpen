Vaccination has a direct effect on lactose intolerance. The overall probability of getting the vaccine is 57%. The probability of vaccine refusal and being lactose intolerant is 32%. The probability of getting the vaccine and being lactose intolerant is 22%. Is the chance of being lactose intolerant larger when observing getting the vaccine?\nStart your answer with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by additional reasoning or evidence to support your explanation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability of being lactose intolerant in the general population is 32% (P(LI)). The probability of being vaccinated is 57% (P(V)). To find the probability of being lactose intolerant when the person has been vaccinated, we need to consider the joint probability of being both vaccinated and lactose intolerant, which is 22% (P(V ∩ LI)). The law of total probability states that the probability of being lactose intolerant when the person has been vaccinated is the joint probability of being both vaccinated and lactose intolerant, divided by the probability of being vaccinated: P(LI|V) = (P(V) * P(LI|V)) / P(V) = (0.57 * 0.22) / 0.57 = 0.22. This is the same as the probability of being lactose intolerant in the general population, which is 0.32. The chance of being lactose intolerant is not larger when observing that the person has been vaccinated.<|eot_id|>",
